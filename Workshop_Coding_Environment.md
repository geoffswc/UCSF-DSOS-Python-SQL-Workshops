# Guidelines For Choosing a Notebook Environment For This Workshop Series

The choice of computing environment matters. It shapes how we learn and what skills we develop.

Our choice of Notebook Environment course has two priorities - accessiblity and autonomy. Our goal is to:

1. Remove unnecessary obstacles so we can focus on learning.
2. Build independence so you can choose when to use commercial or cloud-based systems.
We want you to understand the tools deeply enough that convenience becomes a choice — not a dependency.

## 1. No Financial Risk

You shouldn’t need to enter a credit card just to learn how to code.

This platform:

- Is free to use  
- Does not require billing information  
- Eliminates the risk of accidental charges  

That keeps things equitable and stress-free.

---

## 2. No Setup Headaches

Installing Python, managing environments, and debugging mysterious package errors can eat up hours, especially across different operating systems. 
And it can really derail you in the middle of a workshop!

A hosted notebook:

- Runs entirely in the browser  
- Requires no installation  
- Works the same on Windows, macOS, or Linux  

We can start coding immediately instead of troubleshooting.

---

## 3. Same Environment for Everyone

When everyone works in the same preconfigured setup:

- The same libraries are installed  
- Versions are consistent  
- Code behaves the same for all of us  

That means less time fixing environment issues and more time learning concepts.

---

## 4. Built for Data Science and ML

The platform already includes:

- Jupyter-style notebooks  
- Core data science libraries (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, etc.)  
- Machine learning frameworks  
- Optional GPU access for deeper experiments  

So we can move quickly from theory to hands-on work.

---

## 5. Focus on Thinking, Not Infrastructure

In this course, we’re here to learn:

- How programs work  
- How to analyze data  
- How models learn  
- How AI systems are built  

We’re *not* here to learn cloud billing systems or DevOps configuration (at least not yet).

| **Google Colab (Free)** | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ (runtime resets) | ✅ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **SageMaker Studio Lab** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Local Jupyter Install** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **AWS / GCP / Azure** | ❌ (credit card required) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ⭐⭐ |


# Why We’re Using a Local Jupyter Environment

When choosing a platform for learning programming, data science, and AI, the goal isn’t just convenience — it’s building real capability.

While hosted notebook environments are convenient, this course will continue to include a **local Jupyter setup**.

## 1. You Don't Have to Commit to A Big Corporation

I want to be sure that you have the option of untethering as possible to a large corporation. This is consistent with the workshop series emphasis on open source 
technologies that don't require an account with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI, or other cloud and service providers. We will certainly explore these tools and 
discuss when they outperform open source technologies. But my goal in this workshop is to give you as much control as I possibly can over your computing environment. 

## 1. Full Control Over Your Environment

When you run Python locally:

- You control your installed packages  
- You manage your versions  
- You decide how your environment is configured  
- Your tools don’t disappear when a cloud service changes policy  

This is how real-world development works.

Learning to manage your own environment is part of becoming technically fluent.

---

## 2. Work Completely Offline

A local setup:

- Does not require internet access  
- Is not dependent on platform uptime  
- Cannot be rate-limited or disconnected  
- Works anywhere  

You own your workflow.

---

## 3. Data Stays on Your Machine

For many domains (especially research, healthcare, and industry work):

- Data cannot leave a secure environment  
- Cloud uploads may not be permitted  
- Privacy and compliance matter  

Running locally ensures that:

- Your data stays on your laptop  
- You control access  
- You reduce exposure risk  

This is increasingly important in professional settings.

## 4. You May Need to Use Jupyter in a Secure Computing Environment

UCSF RAE, for example, allows you to use Jupyter Notebook in a highly secure, hosted environment. Other university environments may offer something similar. 
You may need to install, configure, and run Juypyter Notebook to be able to access an environment like this. 

## 5. Modern Laptops Are Powerful

Today’s laptops can:

- Process millions of rows of data  
- Train meaningful machine learning models  
- Run deep learning experiments  
- Handle substantial computation  

For educational purposes, a local machine is more than sufficient for:

- Programming exercises  
- Data science workflows  
- Classical machine learning  
- Introductory deep learning  

Cloud GPUs are helpful — but not necessary for foundational learning or even analysis of fairly large datasets.

## 5. Yes, Installation Is Harder

We acknowledge that:

- Installing Python can be frustrating  
- Package conflicts happen  
- Operating systems behave differently  

But learning to:

- Install tools  
- Manage environments  
- Troubleshoot issues  

Is part of developing real technical independence.
