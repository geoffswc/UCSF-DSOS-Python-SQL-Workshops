Year-end results for 2015 indicate that the initiative, known as 5by20, has reached a total of more than 1.2 million women entrepreneurs across 60 countries since its launch in 2010.    More than 372,000 women entrepreneurs were enabled by 5by20 in 2015, increasing the total number of women participants by 43 percent over the course of the year. This growth can be attributed primarily to programs scaling and replicating in the Eurasia- Africa and Asia-Pacific regions.    ""We believe thriving, sustainable communities are critical for a sustainable business and women are absolutely essential to our success,"" said Bea Perez, Chief Sustainability Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. ""We still have a significant amount of work to do, but I am proud of the progress we are making. It's inspiring when I am able to meet the participants and see firsthand how 5by20 is transforming the lives  pgNbr=1 of women, families and communities around the world.""    5by20 focuses on helping women entrepreneurs across the Coca-Cola value chain --agricultural producers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, recyclers and artisans � overcome challenges when establishing and growing their business. By providing access to business skills, financial services, assets and support networks of peers and mentors, 5by20 is helping women succeed as entrepreneurs, while also helping create sustainable communities.    Market Results: South Africa    In 2013, Coca-Cola and Ipsos, a leading global market research company, began conducting an impact study of 101 women entrepreneurs in Guateng and North West provinces near Johannesburg, South Africa. These women retailers were part of a larger 5by20 business skills training program implemented in collaboration with partners UN Women and Hand in Hand Southern Africa. Results collected over 18 months indicate that, on average, women entrepreneurs participating in the study saw increases in sales and personal income, which they were able to use for basic expenses for their families and to put into savings accounts.    Specific data points from the study include:    - Average business sales increased 44% and data indicates average personal income increased 23% over one year (July 2014-July 2015).    - More than half (54%) of participants reported their business improved 'a lot' as a result of the training. Of those women reporting their business improved 'a lot', more than half saw an increase in personal income.    - On average, since baseline, women showed an increased ability to afford basic expenses for themselves and their family, such as school expenses for children's education, medical visits, and clothing.    - Approximately two-thirds participants reported they were able to put money in savings each month.    - More than 90% of women included in the study said they were confident they will keep their business open and will be able to grow.    ""These data points indicate that women participating in our 5by20 initiative are achieving sustainable progress in being economically empowered,"" said Therese Gearhart, president of Coca-Cola Southern Africa. ""An educated, successful and empowered woman creates a ripple effect throughout her community when she can afford her children's education, provide basic medical needs for her family and help support and mentor other women entrepreneurs. The entire community benefits.""    Partnerships with organizations such as UN Women, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), International Finance Corporation (IFC) MercyCorps, TechnoServe, Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation, Hand in Hand Southern Africa, and many regional and local partners around the world are critical to the success of The Coca-ColaCompany's 5by20 initiative.    As such, Coca-Cola recently committed to collaborate with IDB, UN Women, UN Global Compact and others to develop a new diagnostic tool to help companies achieve equality between men and women in the workplace, marketplace and community. This new tool will help companies assess performance against the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs), identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities, benchmark progress against peers, laws and industry standards,  pgNbr=2 highlight good practices and set concrete targets and performance indicators.

Our statement and key background information included.    Jury Sides With Coca-Cola in False-Advertising Suit by Pom Dow Jones Institutional News, By Mike Esterl, Tuesday, 22 March 2016, 00:03 GMT, 339 Words, Copyright � 2016, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (Document DJDN000020160322ec3m00009)    A California jury sided Monday with Coca-Cola Co. in a false-advertising lawsuit lodged by Pom Wonderful LLC, which alleged Coke had misled consumers by marketing a pomegranate juice that contained little pomegranate.    Pom had been seeking roughly $78 million in damages from Coke, but jurors in the nearly decade-old federal case ruled closely held Pom, a leading maker of pomegranate juice, hadn't proved Coke's labeling was misleading and wasn't entitled to any money.    Coke dropped its Minute Maid pomegranate-blueberry juice in 2014 amid weak sales but argued the drink's labeling complied with Food and Drug Administration requirements despite containing less than 1% pomegranate juice.    Pom filed the lawsuit in 2008, and the U.S. Supreme Court mled in 2014 that it could proceed under federal trademark law, regardless of government regulations on juice labeling.    Pom said Monday that it was disappointed in the jury's decision and reiterated the disputed product was mostly apple and grape juice. A Pom spokeswoman added the company hadn't determined its next legal steps, if any.    Coke said it was pleased with Monday's verdict, reiterating its juice was clearly and properly labeled. It has argued the packaging depicted all five fmits used in the juice and that it informed consumers the beverage tasted like pomegranate and blueberry.    This month's jury trial was held in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.    A federal appeals court sided last year with the Federal Trade Commission in a separate case, mling the government could prohibit Pom from marketing its products as effective in fighting heart disease, prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction.    Pom said Monday that it would continue to publicize $40 million in peer-reviewed research highlighting the benefits of ""amazing, antioxidant-rich"" pomegranate juice.

Year-end results for 2015 indicate that the initiative, known as 5by20, has reached a total of more than 1.2 million women entrepreneurs across 60 countries since its launch in 2010.    More than 372,000 women entrepreneurs were enabled by 5by20 in 2015, increasing the total number of women participants by 43 percent over the course of the year. This growth can be attributed primarily to programs scaling and replicating in the Eurasia-Africa and Asia-Pacific regions.    ""We believe thriving, sustainable communities are critical for a sustainable business and women are absolutely essential to our success,"" said Bea Perez, Chief Sustainability Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. ""We still have a significant amount of work to do, but I am proud of the progress we are making. It's inspiring when I am able to meet the participants and see firsthand how 5by20 is transforming the lives of women, families and communities around the world.""    5by20 focuses on helping women entrepreneurs across the Coca-Cola value chain -agricultural producers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, recyclers and artisans -overcome challenges when establishing and growing their business. By providing access to business skills, financial services, assets and support networks of peers and mentors, 5by20 is helping women succeed as entrepreneurs, while also helping create sustainable communities.    Market Results: South Africa    In 2013, Coca-Cola and Ipsos, a leading global market research company, began conducting an impact study of 101 women entrepreneurs in Guateng and North West provinces near Johannesburg, South Africa. These women retailers were part of a larger 5by20 business skills training program implemented in collaboration with partners UN Women and Hand in Hand Southern Africa. Results collected over 18 months indicate that, on average, women entrepreneurs participating in the study saw increases in sales and personal income, which they were able to use for basic expenses for their families and to put into savings accounts.    IVledia Contact:    April Jordan    Corporals External Affairs    T +01,404, 676.2683    press@coca-cola.com    The Coca-Cola Company Global Public Affairs & Communications Dept.    P.O. Box 1734 Atlanta, GA 30301  pgNbr=5 Specific data points from the study include:    - Average business sales increased 44% and data indicates average personal income increased 23% over one year (July 2014-July 2015).    - More than half (54%) of participants reported their business improved 'a lot' as a result of the training. Of those women reporting their business improved 'a lot', more than half saw an increase in personal income.    - On average, since baseline, women showed an increased ability to afford basic expenses for themselves and their family, such as school expenses for children's education, medical visits, and clothing.    - Approximately two-thirds participants reported they were able to put money in savings each month.    - More than 90% of women included in the study said they were confident they will keep their business open and will be able to grow.    ""These data points indicate that women participating in our 5by20 initiative are achieving sustainable progress in being economically empowered,"" said Therese Gearhart, president of Coca-Cola Southern Africa. ""An educated, successful and empowered woman creates a ripple effect throughout her community when she can afford her children's education, provide basic medical needs for her family and help support and mentor other women entrepreneurs. The entire community benefits.""    Partnerships with organizations such as UN Women, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), International Finance Corporation (IFC) MercyCorps, TechnoServe, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Hand in Hand Southern Africa, and many regional and local partners around the world are critical to the success of The Coca-Cola Company's 5by20 initiative.    As such, Coca-Cola recently committed to collaborate with IDB, UN Women, UN Global Compact and others to develop a new diagnostic tool to help companies achieve equality between men and women in the workplace, marketplace and community. This new tool will help companies assess performance against the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs), identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities, benchmark progress against peers, laws and industry standards, highlight good practices and set concrete targets and performance indicators.

Key objective is to expose OECD staff and Member States representations to the various initiatives the broad industry is taking to address the risk factors for NCD's (such as overweight and obesity, physical inactivity and alcohol use). In particular we want to highlight the importance of healthy and sustainable communities for a healthy business environment and how industry is leveraging its innovation-capabilities to support consumers and communities.    TCCC has driven the process within industry to get BIAC to be more vocal with the OECD staff on its work related to public health and obesity. It is a next step in our engagement, following a successful workshop in 2015 with OECD-staff and representatives from among others The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation and EPODE.    The OECD Health Department is becoming an increasingly influential voice in the debate on cost-effectiveness of obesity-interventions. The OECD team is partnering with the European Commission and WHO Europe on various workstreams related to this. We anticipate the OECD Health Department to issue end 2016/relay 2017 an update of its influential paper on ""the economics of prevention, fit not fat"".

(NYSE: KO) will change its parental leave policy in 2017 thanks to pressure from its millennial employees.    Starting Jan. 1, 2017, the Atlanta-based beverage giant will offer six weeks of paid leave to all of its new parents, including moms and dads and adoptive and foster parents.    <image001.png>    The move was pushed by Coca-Cola Millennial Voices, a group of employees tapped to serve as a kickstarter for change to help the company attract and retain millennial employees and consumers. Internal surveys and external research highlighted the value their peers place on parental leave and revealed the average age of first-time, college-educated parents is 30, which is also the median age of Coca-Cola's current and prospective millennial employees. Millennial will account for more than half of the global Coca-Cola system workforce by 2020.    The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a 12-month period to care for a newborn, adopted or foster child. The law applies to private employers with 50 or more employees.    According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 21 percent of large U.S. corporations offered paid maternity leave in 2015, up from 12 percent in 2014.    Coke to offer six week paid leave for all new parents in 2017    The Atlanta Journal Constitution By: Leon Stafford 11 April 2016    Beginning next January, Coca-Cola will offer U.S. employees who are new parents � including mothers, fathers, adoptive parents and those providing foster care � six weeks of paid leave.    The new benefits will supplement the time off Coke currently gives to birth mothers � roughly six to eight weeks  pgNbr=5 of paid leave � through short-term disability.    ""Fostering an inclusive workplace means valuing all parents - no matter their gender or sexual orientation,"" Ceree Eberly, Coke's Chief People Officer, said on the company's website Monday. ""We think the most successful way to structure benefits to help working families is to make them gender-neutral and encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives.""    The company, citing statistics from the Society for Human Resource Management, said 21 percent of large U.S. businesses offered paid maternity leave in 2015, up from 12 percent in 2014.    A key component of Coke's new policy is gender neutrality. By offering the paid leave to both women and men, the company hopes to avoid a ""moms-only"" bias that some have argued has cost women job opportunities.    Coca-Cola Credits Millennials For Its Extended Paid Parental Leave Policy    Fortune    By: Kristen Bellstrom    11 April 2016    Coca-Cola Company is the latest employer to extend its paid leave policy beyond biological mothers�and it's giving millennials props for spurring the change.    In a blog post on Monday, the soft drink giant announced that, starting Jan. 1, 2017, it will offer six weeks of fully paid leave to new parents in the U.S. �including biological, adoptive, and foster moms and dads. Those new benefits will augment Coke's current benefits, which offer birth mothers six to eight weeks of paid leave through short-term disability. Roughly 40,000 workers will be covered by the new policy.    ""Fostering an inclusive workplace means valuing all parents�no matter their gender or sexual orientation,"" said Ceree Eberly, the company's chief people officer, in the post. ""We think the most successful way to structure benefits to help working families is to make them gender-neutral and encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives.""    However, it's worth noting that the new policy will not apply to Coke's roughly 17,500 North American employees covered by collective bargaining. That workforce includes production and warehouse employees. According to a Coca-Cola spokesperson, those employees are covered under ""varying short-term disability benefits offered for birthing mothers who can claim short-term disability depending on each contract.""    Coke isn't the only company to exclude some workers from its generous policy. Last summer, Netflix NFLX 0.08% made a big splash with its ""unlimited"" paid leave policy�only to come under fire when it became clear that the new benefits did not extend to workers in its DVD division. (The streaming company did revise its paid leave policy for DVD and customer service center employees in December, though they still receive less leave than the company's other workers.)    In the Monday post, Coca-Cola credited the new policy to ""Coca-Cola Millennial Voices,"" an internal group dedicated to helping the company attract and retain millennial workers and consumers, which helped draft and push the policy through HR and executive approvals.    It makes sense that Coke is touting the new benefits as an appeal to millennials. Recent research from EY found that millennial parents are much more likely to take paid parental leave (48%) than parents of older generations were when they had kids (35% of Gen Xers and 24% of boomers). The gender-neutral nature of the revised policy is also likely to resonate with younger workers; numerous studies have found millennial men have more egalitarian ideas about child rearing than previous generations (though they continue to be less likely to take parental leave than millennial women).    The blog post quotes 32-year-old Valerie Alva-Ruiz, a Coke employee and mother of a 16-month-old daughter, who underlines the importance of a policy that offers ""not only offer paid leave for mothers but also for fathers  pgNbr=6 who deserve that bonding time to be equally involved.""    Coca-Cola (KO) Announces New Family Leave Policy: It's Not Just Tech Companies Anymore    The Street    By: Eric Reed    11 April 2016    Link: http.L/./www^    jujCTech^^^    Future parents at Coca-Cola today got some good news, as the company announced an expansion of its parental leave policy. The new rules, which take effect January 1, 2017, will offer six weeks of paid leave to birth mothers, fathers and foster parents alike.    And, according to the company, Millennial are responsible.    In an announce^ment on its website earlier today, Coca-Cola unveiled its new policy,whjc.h.wii^ pJ.the.s�hoxt:texm.djsjbi!ity offered to new birth mothers. The company attributed the decision to its Millennial Voices co.mrn.Lt.tee, a group of young employees the company brought together ""to help Coke recruit and retain Millennial talent.""    With the aging of the cohort - the oldest Millennial are now 35 - pmenta.Lissu.eshave increasingly become a major topic for them in the workplace and, as a result, an important issue for employers when it comes to recruitment and retention. The average age of a first time, college educated parent these days is 30, and in extending its leave policy, the company said that outreach to these younger workers was one of its key considerations.    ""Increasingly Millennial are becoming moms and dads,"" said employee Katherine Cherry in the press release. ""Paid parental leave isn't just a nice thing to do - it's the smart thing to do for our business.""    The inclusive policy addresses one of the concerns worldwide with parental and maternity leave programs, as many observers have pointed out that without universal leave that extends to both fathers and mothers, women can be seen as a special liability to employers. Despite laws banning gender preferences, maternity programs can create bias against women as bosses see them as someone who may up and leave the company for weeks, or even months, at a time.    In fact, studies have found that companies with highly generous maternity leave programs often promote female executives at a slower rate than men. Extending the program to all employees eliminates that special category of risk.    Coke's decision will affect non-bargaining employees in the U.S., ^d.tJlis.mo.Y.e.JILake5�the�C.Qmp.aD.y�lJl�Jate5i burMnejsstojim^^                     increasingly generous family leave by private employers. Companies such as    Twitter (JWTR. - G.et.R.epo.rt)and Facebook (FB - G.et.R.eport) have announced robust programs, with Twitter alone offering 20 weeks paid time off.    However, this trend has kept largely (although not exclusively) to the youth- and male-dominated tech industry. The move by a company as sprawling and diverse as Coke-a-Cola shows a shift away from that sector and towards more widespread acceptance of the need for more sweeping parental leave programs.    Companies have been filling the gap left by government action, as America is one of the only countries in the world that doesn't enforce some form of universal paid leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act is the only national protection and allows up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off for full time staff at organizations with 50 or more employees; however, many critics have argued that this is impossible for all but the most well off to actually take advantage of.    Recently the state of New.York.made. news by extending its protections to 12 weeks of partially paid family leave, making it the most generous state in the union.  pgNbr=7 Coca-Cola Will Offer More Inclusive Parental Leave, Because Miiienniais    The company's younger employees convinced it to change its unfair policy. The Huffington Post By: Emily Peck 11 April 2016    New parents at Coke will get six weeks paid time off when their kids arrive.    Citing the influence of its millennial employees and the need to promote gender equality at work, Coca-Cola on    Monday announced a far more inclusive paid parental leave policy.    Previously, Coke only gave six to eight weeks paid leave to female employees who gave birth. But starting in January, all new parents at Coke � including dads, adoptive and foster parents � will be entitled to six weeks off upon the arrival of their kids. Birth mothers will also be entitled to an additional six to eight weeks leave. The new benefit is not available to unionized Coke workers. Overall 40,000 employees are eligible, out of 60,000 in the U.S.    ""Fostering an inclusive workplace means valuing all parents - no matter their gender or sexual orientation,"" Ceree Eberly, Coke's chief people officer, said in an announcement on the company's website. ""We think the most successful way to structure benefits to help working families is to make them gender-neutral and encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives.""    The company, which took in $44 billion in revenue last year, said the policy was ""championed"" by a formal group of millennial employees who had been asked to come up with ideas for attracting and retaining younger workers. By 2020, Coke expects more than half of its workforce will be of the ""millennial generation,"" born between 1981 and 1997.    Interestingly, while Coca Cola works hard to attract miiienniais, they seem less and less enthusiastic about Coke's core product. As miiienniais (and other Americans) have stopped buying and drinking a lot of soda, they've forced a big shift in the company's business model. Coke is now pushing smaller serving sizes and a wider array of drinks in an effort to keep up sales.    Coke also said it believes opening up paid leave to men will help ""combat bias"" at work. Only offering parental leave to women is generally believed to put them on unequal footing with their male counterparts, and to facilitate a lack of mutual understanding between the sexes at work.    And only offering parental leave to birth parents also discriminates against LGBT moms and dads, as well as adoptive and foster parents and anyone who uses a surrogate.    The United States is the only developed country in the world that does not offer any kind of paid time off to new mothers, leaving it to individual companies to pick up the slack.    Coke is just the latest company to broaden its parental leave policy to cover more workers. Over the past year or so, many others � mostly in the ultra-competitive tech space � have beefed up their paid leave policies, in an effort to attract and retain workers.    The question now is, how many new dads at Coke will take their six weeks? Even when men are offered paid leave, they often don't take it, because men aren't traditionally expected to stay home when kids arrive on the scene. At Facebook, for example, men take on average about half the time off offered to them, according to The New York Times.    ""In addition to new policies, businesses must embrace inclusive cultures in which men and women know that they actually can take the leave and not be punished for it,"" said Josh Levs, the author of All In, a book about fatherhood and the workplace. ""Sadly, the American workplace is still plagued by stigmas.""  pgNbr=8 Coca-Cola releases new gender-neutral paid parental leave benefits    Fast Company    By: Staff    11 April 2016    The soft drink giant just announced an enhanced paid parental leave policy for its more than 40,000 U.S. employees. According to a company statement:    ""The policy, which takes effect Jan. 1, 2017, offers six weeks of paid leave to all new parents at the company, including moms and dads, and adoptive and foster parents. These benefits supplement the six to eight weeks of paid leave Coke currently provides to birth mothers through short-term disability.""    The benefit was designed to be gender-neutral to ""encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives,"" says Ceree Eberly, Coca-Cola Company's chief people officer/    An internal cohort of young employees called Coca-Cola Millennial Voices is behind the change. The company's global workforce of nearly 130,000 is expected to be more than half millennial by 2020.    Coca-Cola Will Offer Paid Leave For All New Parents, Because It's 2016    Romper    By Becky Bracken    11 April 2016    Coca Cola wanted to figure out how to recruit and retain the best millennial employees, so it gathered a focus group of employees and listened to what they wanted: paid leave for all employees. Yes, millennials convinced Coca-Cola to offer paid leave for both men and women, and it's a huge step toward gender equality in the workplace that women have needed for decades and that more and more companies are beginning to understand. The new paid-leave-for-all-new-parents benefit will kick in on Jan. 1 2017.    Why is it important for all parents, regardless of gender, to have the opportunity to stay home to take care of new additions to the family? Dads who take parental leave boost equality both in the workplace, because women aren't seen as the sole parent tasked with child rearing, which cuts into their work productivity and advancement. In addition, a father helping out at home balances the load a woman takes on, giving her more time and opportunities at work. It's a beautiful win-win for Coke employees that will hopefully help lead the rest of the workforce to universal paid leave, putting the U.S. on par with the rest of the developed world.    Here's a look at the work of the ""Coca-Cola Millennial Voices"" in action.    But it makes sense. Today, 40 percent of households with kids under 18 have a woman as the primary breadwinner. And, as of 2013, about 70 percent of mothers were in the workforce. To millennials, both men and women, old ideas about gender stereotypes are necessarily giving way to the reality that mom going to work isn't some Mr. Mom hijinks � it's reality, and modern families and modern workplaces are gonna have to adjust.    Just this weekend I was at Target and I saw a dad with his little girl who was about 4 years old walking nearby to their car. When the little girl told her dad she had to go potty, he swung into action like a member of an elite special-ops group. He whipped a potty out of the back of the car, lined it with a Target bag, sat her down, and opened the car door to provide a privacy shield for his little girl. When she was done, he pulled up the bag, tied it and threw it in the trash. It was like a beautifully choreographed ballet. Totally not the way I would have handled it, but it was perfection. That's what I mean. People approach child rearing challenges in a whole different way,  pgNbr=9 and it's fantastic for children to have those experiences with their parents.    Giving both parents paid leave, and the time to do their own parenting thing, is a good thing for their tired, often-working partners and for their kids. Engaged dads live longer, according to a recent study. Because, let's face it, taking care of kids is hard, but it's also a blast. And after taking care of kiddos, you're happy to get back to work.    The millennials finally standing up and working to change the system are doing every family a service, not just their own. And if the reaction from Coca-Cola's Chief People Officer Ceree Eberly is any indication about how employer attitudes about balancing work and family, things are definitely headed in the right direction. ""We think the most successful way to structure benefits to help working families is to make them gender-neutral and encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives,"" Eberly said.    Can I get an ""Amen!?""    With global businesses like Coca Cola, Google, and Netflix setting an example of how companies can adjust benefit packages to accommodate paid leave for all employees, the rest of the U.S. economy is sure to follow, eventually. Even Democratic presidential candidates former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are both on record calling for federally mandated paid leave.    <image002.png>    But it's employees like Coca-Cola's group of ""Millennial Voices"" that are doing the tough work on the ground, leading the country toward a more sane and productive path for modern American workers and their families.    ###    Melina Baetti    Public Affairs & Communications    Coca-Cola North America    T: 404-676-1533    M: 404-272-9211  pgNbr=10 "
