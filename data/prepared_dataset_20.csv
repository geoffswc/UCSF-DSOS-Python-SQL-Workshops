Year-end results for 2015 indicate that the initiative, known as 5by20, has reached a total of more than 1.2 million women entrepreneurs across 60 countries since its launch in 2010.    More than 372,000 women entrepreneurs were enabled by 5by20 in 2015, increasing the total number of women participants by 43 percent over the course of the year. This growth can be attributed primarily to programs scaling and replicating in the Eurasia- Africa and Asia-Pacific regions.    ""We believe thriving, sustainable communities are critical for a sustainable business and women are absolutely essential to our success,"" said Bea Perez, Chief Sustainability Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. ""We still have a significant amount of work to do, but I am proud of the progress we are making. It's inspiring when I am able to meet the participants and see firsthand how 5by20 is transforming the lives  pgNbr=1 of women, families and communities around the world.""    5by20 focuses on helping women entrepreneurs across the Coca-Cola value chain --agricultural producers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, recyclers and artisans � overcome challenges when establishing and growing their business. By providing access to business skills, financial services, assets and support networks of peers and mentors, 5by20 is helping women succeed as entrepreneurs, while also helping create sustainable communities.    Market Results: South Africa    In 2013, Coca-Cola and Ipsos, a leading global market research company, began conducting an impact study of 101 women entrepreneurs in Guateng and North West provinces near Johannesburg, South Africa. These women retailers were part of a larger 5by20 business skills training program implemented in collaboration with partners UN Women and Hand in Hand Southern Africa. Results collected over 18 months indicate that, on average, women entrepreneurs participating in the study saw increases in sales and personal income, which they were able to use for basic expenses for their families and to put into savings accounts.    Specific data points from the study include:    - Average business sales increased 44% and data indicates average personal income increased 23% over one year (July 2014-July 2015).    - More than half (54%) of participants reported their business improved 'a lot' as a result of the training. Of those women reporting their business improved 'a lot', more than half saw an increase in personal income.    - On average, since baseline, women showed an increased ability to afford basic expenses for themselves and their family, such as school expenses for children's education, medical visits, and clothing.    - Approximately two-thirds participants reported they were able to put money in savings each month.    - More than 90% of women included in the study said they were confident they will keep their business open and will be able to grow.    ""These data points indicate that women participating in our 5by20 initiative are achieving sustainable progress in being economically empowered,"" said Therese Gearhart, president of Coca-Cola Southern Africa. ""An educated, successful and empowered woman creates a ripple effect throughout her community when she can afford her children's education, provide basic medical needs for her family and help support and mentor other women entrepreneurs. The entire community benefits.""    Partnerships with organizations such as UN Women, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), International Finance Corporation (IFC) MercyCorps, TechnoServe, Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation, Hand in Hand Southern Africa, and many regional and local partners around the world are critical to the success of The Coca-ColaCompany's 5by20 initiative.    As such, Coca-Cola recently committed to collaborate with IDB, UN Women, UN Global Compact and others to develop a new diagnostic tool to help companies achieve equality between men and women in the workplace, marketplace and community. This new tool will help companies assess performance against the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs), identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities, benchmark progress against peers, laws and industry standards,  pgNbr=2 highlight good practices and set concrete targets and performance indicators.

Our statement and key background information included.    Jury Sides With Coca-Cola in False-Advertising Suit by Pom Dow Jones Institutional News, By Mike Esterl, Tuesday, 22 March 2016, 00:03 GMT, 339 Words, Copyright � 2016, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. (Document DJDN000020160322ec3m00009)    A California jury sided Monday with Coca-Cola Co. in a false-advertising lawsuit lodged by Pom Wonderful LLC, which alleged Coke had misled consumers by marketing a pomegranate juice that contained little pomegranate.    Pom had been seeking roughly $78 million in damages from Coke, but jurors in the nearly decade-old federal case ruled closely held Pom, a leading maker of pomegranate juice, hadn't proved Coke's labeling was misleading and wasn't entitled to any money.    Coke dropped its Minute Maid pomegranate-blueberry juice in 2014 amid weak sales but argued the drink's labeling complied with Food and Drug Administration requirements despite containing less than 1% pomegranate juice.    Pom filed the lawsuit in 2008, and the U.S. Supreme Court mled in 2014 that it could proceed under federal trademark law, regardless of government regulations on juice labeling.    Pom said Monday that it was disappointed in the jury's decision and reiterated the disputed product was mostly apple and grape juice. A Pom spokeswoman added the company hadn't determined its next legal steps, if any.    Coke said it was pleased with Monday's verdict, reiterating its juice was clearly and properly labeled. It has argued the packaging depicted all five fmits used in the juice and that it informed consumers the beverage tasted like pomegranate and blueberry.    This month's jury trial was held in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.    A federal appeals court sided last year with the Federal Trade Commission in a separate case, mling the government could prohibit Pom from marketing its products as effective in fighting heart disease, prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction.    Pom said Monday that it would continue to publicize $40 million in peer-reviewed research highlighting the benefits of ""amazing, antioxidant-rich"" pomegranate juice.

Year-end results for 2015 indicate that the initiative, known as 5by20, has reached a total of more than 1.2 million women entrepreneurs across 60 countries since its launch in 2010.    More than 372,000 women entrepreneurs were enabled by 5by20 in 2015, increasing the total number of women participants by 43 percent over the course of the year. This growth can be attributed primarily to programs scaling and replicating in the Eurasia-Africa and Asia-Pacific regions.    ""We believe thriving, sustainable communities are critical for a sustainable business and women are absolutely essential to our success,"" said Bea Perez, Chief Sustainability Officer of The Coca-Cola Company. ""We still have a significant amount of work to do, but I am proud of the progress we are making. It's inspiring when I am able to meet the participants and see firsthand how 5by20 is transforming the lives of women, families and communities around the world.""    5by20 focuses on helping women entrepreneurs across the Coca-Cola value chain -agricultural producers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, recyclers and artisans -overcome challenges when establishing and growing their business. By providing access to business skills, financial services, assets and support networks of peers and mentors, 5by20 is helping women succeed as entrepreneurs, while also helping create sustainable communities.    Market Results: South Africa    In 2013, Coca-Cola and Ipsos, a leading global market research company, began conducting an impact study of 101 women entrepreneurs in Guateng and North West provinces near Johannesburg, South Africa. These women retailers were part of a larger 5by20 business skills training program implemented in collaboration with partners UN Women and Hand in Hand Southern Africa. Results collected over 18 months indicate that, on average, women entrepreneurs participating in the study saw increases in sales and personal income, which they were able to use for basic expenses for their families and to put into savings accounts.    IVledia Contact:    April Jordan    Corporals External Affairs    T +01,404, 676.2683    press@coca-cola.com    The Coca-Cola Company Global Public Affairs & Communications Dept.    P.O. Box 1734 Atlanta, GA 30301  pgNbr=5 Specific data points from the study include:    - Average business sales increased 44% and data indicates average personal income increased 23% over one year (July 2014-July 2015).    - More than half (54%) of participants reported their business improved 'a lot' as a result of the training. Of those women reporting their business improved 'a lot', more than half saw an increase in personal income.    - On average, since baseline, women showed an increased ability to afford basic expenses for themselves and their family, such as school expenses for children's education, medical visits, and clothing.    - Approximately two-thirds participants reported they were able to put money in savings each month.    - More than 90% of women included in the study said they were confident they will keep their business open and will be able to grow.    ""These data points indicate that women participating in our 5by20 initiative are achieving sustainable progress in being economically empowered,"" said Therese Gearhart, president of Coca-Cola Southern Africa. ""An educated, successful and empowered woman creates a ripple effect throughout her community when she can afford her children's education, provide basic medical needs for her family and help support and mentor other women entrepreneurs. The entire community benefits.""    Partnerships with organizations such as UN Women, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), International Finance Corporation (IFC) MercyCorps, TechnoServe, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Hand in Hand Southern Africa, and many regional and local partners around the world are critical to the success of The Coca-Cola Company's 5by20 initiative.    As such, Coca-Cola recently committed to collaborate with IDB, UN Women, UN Global Compact and others to develop a new diagnostic tool to help companies achieve equality between men and women in the workplace, marketplace and community. This new tool will help companies assess performance against the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs), identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities, benchmark progress against peers, laws and industry standards, highlight good practices and set concrete targets and performance indicators.

Key objective is to expose OECD staff and Member States representations to the various initiatives the broad industry is taking to address the risk factors for NCD's (such as overweight and obesity, physical inactivity and alcohol use). In particular we want to highlight the importance of healthy and sustainable communities for a healthy business environment and how industry is leveraging its innovation-capabilities to support consumers and communities.    TCCC has driven the process within industry to get BIAC to be more vocal with the OECD staff on its work related to public health and obesity. It is a next step in our engagement, following a successful workshop in 2015 with OECD-staff and representatives from among others The Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation and EPODE.    The OECD Health Department is becoming an increasingly influential voice in the debate on cost-effectiveness of obesity-interventions. The OECD team is partnering with the European Commission and WHO Europe on various workstreams related to this. We anticipate the OECD Health Department to issue end 2016/relay 2017 an update of its influential paper on ""the economics of prevention, fit not fat"".

(NYSE: KO) will change its parental leave policy in 2017 thanks to pressure from its millennial employees.    Starting Jan. 1, 2017, the Atlanta-based beverage giant will offer six weeks of paid leave to all of its new parents, including moms and dads and adoptive and foster parents.    <image001.png>    The move was pushed by Coca-Cola Millennial Voices, a group of employees tapped to serve as a kickstarter for change to help the company attract and retain millennial employees and consumers. Internal surveys and external research highlighted the value their peers place on parental leave and revealed the average age of first-time, college-educated parents is 30, which is also the median age of Coca-Cola's current and prospective millennial employees. Millennial will account for more than half of the global Coca-Cola system workforce by 2020.    The U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a 12-month period to care for a newborn, adopted or foster child. The law applies to private employers with 50 or more employees.    According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 21 percent of large U.S. corporations offered paid maternity leave in 2015, up from 12 percent in 2014.    Coke to offer six week paid leave for all new parents in 2017    The Atlanta Journal Constitution By: Leon Stafford 11 April 2016    Beginning next January, Coca-Cola will offer U.S. employees who are new parents � including mothers, fathers, adoptive parents and those providing foster care � six weeks of paid leave.    The new benefits will supplement the time off Coke currently gives to birth mothers � roughly six to eight weeks  pgNbr=5 of paid leave � through short-term disability.    ""Fostering an inclusive workplace means valuing all parents - no matter their gender or sexual orientation,"" Ceree Eberly, Coke's Chief People Officer, said on the company's website Monday. ""We think the most successful way to structure benefits to help working families is to make them gender-neutral and encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives.""    The company, citing statistics from the Society for Human Resource Management, said 21 percent of large U.S. businesses offered paid maternity leave in 2015, up from 12 percent in 2014.    A key component of Coke's new policy is gender neutrality. By offering the paid leave to both women and men, the company hopes to avoid a ""moms-only"" bias that some have argued has cost women job opportunities.    Coca-Cola Credits Millennials For Its Extended Paid Parental Leave Policy    Fortune    By: Kristen Bellstrom    11 April 2016    Coca-Cola Company is the latest employer to extend its paid leave policy beyond biological mothers�and it's giving millennials props for spurring the change.    In a blog post on Monday, the soft drink giant announced that, starting Jan. 1, 2017, it will offer six weeks of fully paid leave to new parents in the U.S. �including biological, adoptive, and foster moms and dads. Those new benefits will augment Coke's current benefits, which offer birth mothers six to eight weeks of paid leave through short-term disability. Roughly 40,000 workers will be covered by the new policy.    ""Fostering an inclusive workplace means valuing all parents�no matter their gender or sexual orientation,"" said Ceree Eberly, the company's chief people officer, in the post. ""We think the most successful way to structure benefits to help working families is to make them gender-neutral and encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives.""    However, it's worth noting that the new policy will not apply to Coke's roughly 17,500 North American employees covered by collective bargaining. That workforce includes production and warehouse employees. According to a Coca-Cola spokesperson, those employees are covered under ""varying short-term disability benefits offered for birthing mothers who can claim short-term disability depending on each contract.""    Coke isn't the only company to exclude some workers from its generous policy. Last summer, Netflix NFLX 0.08% made a big splash with its ""unlimited"" paid leave policy�only to come under fire when it became clear that the new benefits did not extend to workers in its DVD division. (The streaming company did revise its paid leave policy for DVD and customer service center employees in December, though they still receive less leave than the company's other workers.)    In the Monday post, Coca-Cola credited the new policy to ""Coca-Cola Millennial Voices,"" an internal group dedicated to helping the company attract and retain millennial workers and consumers, which helped draft and push the policy through HR and executive approvals.    It makes sense that Coke is touting the new benefits as an appeal to millennials. Recent research from EY found that millennial parents are much more likely to take paid parental leave (48%) than parents of older generations were when they had kids (35% of Gen Xers and 24% of boomers). The gender-neutral nature of the revised policy is also likely to resonate with younger workers; numerous studies have found millennial men have more egalitarian ideas about child rearing than previous generations (though they continue to be less likely to take parental leave than millennial women).    The blog post quotes 32-year-old Valerie Alva-Ruiz, a Coke employee and mother of a 16-month-old daughter, who underlines the importance of a policy that offers ""not only offer paid leave for mothers but also for fathers  pgNbr=6 who deserve that bonding time to be equally involved.""    Coca-Cola (KO) Announces New Family Leave Policy: It's Not Just Tech Companies Anymore    The Street    By: Eric Reed    11 April 2016    Link: http.L/./www^    jujCTech^^^    Future parents at Coca-Cola today got some good news, as the company announced an expansion of its parental leave policy. The new rules, which take effect January 1, 2017, will offer six weeks of paid leave to birth mothers, fathers and foster parents alike.    And, according to the company, Millennial are responsible.    In an announce^ment on its website earlier today, Coca-Cola unveiled its new policy,whjc.h.wii^ pJ.the.s�hoxt:texm.djsjbi!ity offered to new birth mothers. The company attributed the decision to its Millennial Voices co.mrn.Lt.tee, a group of young employees the company brought together ""to help Coke recruit and retain Millennial talent.""    With the aging of the cohort - the oldest Millennial are now 35 - pmenta.Lissu.eshave increasingly become a major topic for them in the workplace and, as a result, an important issue for employers when it comes to recruitment and retention. The average age of a first time, college educated parent these days is 30, and in extending its leave policy, the company said that outreach to these younger workers was one of its key considerations.    ""Increasingly Millennial are becoming moms and dads,"" said employee Katherine Cherry in the press release. ""Paid parental leave isn't just a nice thing to do - it's the smart thing to do for our business.""    The inclusive policy addresses one of the concerns worldwide with parental and maternity leave programs, as many observers have pointed out that without universal leave that extends to both fathers and mothers, women can be seen as a special liability to employers. Despite laws banning gender preferences, maternity programs can create bias against women as bosses see them as someone who may up and leave the company for weeks, or even months, at a time.    In fact, studies have found that companies with highly generous maternity leave programs often promote female executives at a slower rate than men. Extending the program to all employees eliminates that special category of risk.    Coke's decision will affect non-bargaining employees in the U.S., ^d.tJlis.mo.Y.e.JILake5�the�C.Qmp.aD.y�lJl�Jate5i burMnejsstojim^^                     increasingly generous family leave by private employers. Companies such as    Twitter (JWTR. - G.et.R.epo.rt)and Facebook (FB - G.et.R.eport) have announced robust programs, with Twitter alone offering 20 weeks paid time off.    However, this trend has kept largely (although not exclusively) to the youth- and male-dominated tech industry. The move by a company as sprawling and diverse as Coke-a-Cola shows a shift away from that sector and towards more widespread acceptance of the need for more sweeping parental leave programs.    Companies have been filling the gap left by government action, as America is one of the only countries in the world that doesn't enforce some form of universal paid leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act is the only national protection and allows up to 12 weeks of unpaid time off for full time staff at organizations with 50 or more employees; however, many critics have argued that this is impossible for all but the most well off to actually take advantage of.    Recently the state of New.York.made. news by extending its protections to 12 weeks of partially paid family leave, making it the most generous state in the union.  pgNbr=7 Coca-Cola Will Offer More Inclusive Parental Leave, Because Miiienniais    The company's younger employees convinced it to change its unfair policy. The Huffington Post By: Emily Peck 11 April 2016    New parents at Coke will get six weeks paid time off when their kids arrive.    Citing the influence of its millennial employees and the need to promote gender equality at work, Coca-Cola on    Monday announced a far more inclusive paid parental leave policy.    Previously, Coke only gave six to eight weeks paid leave to female employees who gave birth. But starting in January, all new parents at Coke � including dads, adoptive and foster parents � will be entitled to six weeks off upon the arrival of their kids. Birth mothers will also be entitled to an additional six to eight weeks leave. The new benefit is not available to unionized Coke workers. Overall 40,000 employees are eligible, out of 60,000 in the U.S.    ""Fostering an inclusive workplace means valuing all parents - no matter their gender or sexual orientation,"" Ceree Eberly, Coke's chief people officer, said in an announcement on the company's website. ""We think the most successful way to structure benefits to help working families is to make them gender-neutral and encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives.""    The company, which took in $44 billion in revenue last year, said the policy was ""championed"" by a formal group of millennial employees who had been asked to come up with ideas for attracting and retaining younger workers. By 2020, Coke expects more than half of its workforce will be of the ""millennial generation,"" born between 1981 and 1997.    Interestingly, while Coca Cola works hard to attract miiienniais, they seem less and less enthusiastic about Coke's core product. As miiienniais (and other Americans) have stopped buying and drinking a lot of soda, they've forced a big shift in the company's business model. Coke is now pushing smaller serving sizes and a wider array of drinks in an effort to keep up sales.    Coke also said it believes opening up paid leave to men will help ""combat bias"" at work. Only offering parental leave to women is generally believed to put them on unequal footing with their male counterparts, and to facilitate a lack of mutual understanding between the sexes at work.    And only offering parental leave to birth parents also discriminates against LGBT moms and dads, as well as adoptive and foster parents and anyone who uses a surrogate.    The United States is the only developed country in the world that does not offer any kind of paid time off to new mothers, leaving it to individual companies to pick up the slack.    Coke is just the latest company to broaden its parental leave policy to cover more workers. Over the past year or so, many others � mostly in the ultra-competitive tech space � have beefed up their paid leave policies, in an effort to attract and retain workers.    The question now is, how many new dads at Coke will take their six weeks? Even when men are offered paid leave, they often don't take it, because men aren't traditionally expected to stay home when kids arrive on the scene. At Facebook, for example, men take on average about half the time off offered to them, according to The New York Times.    ""In addition to new policies, businesses must embrace inclusive cultures in which men and women know that they actually can take the leave and not be punished for it,"" said Josh Levs, the author of All In, a book about fatherhood and the workplace. ""Sadly, the American workplace is still plagued by stigmas.""  pgNbr=8 Coca-Cola releases new gender-neutral paid parental leave benefits    Fast Company    By: Staff    11 April 2016    The soft drink giant just announced an enhanced paid parental leave policy for its more than 40,000 U.S. employees. According to a company statement:    ""The policy, which takes effect Jan. 1, 2017, offers six weeks of paid leave to all new parents at the company, including moms and dads, and adoptive and foster parents. These benefits supplement the six to eight weeks of paid leave Coke currently provides to birth mothers through short-term disability.""    The benefit was designed to be gender-neutral to ""encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives,"" says Ceree Eberly, Coca-Cola Company's chief people officer/    An internal cohort of young employees called Coca-Cola Millennial Voices is behind the change. The company's global workforce of nearly 130,000 is expected to be more than half millennial by 2020.    Coca-Cola Will Offer Paid Leave For All New Parents, Because It's 2016    Romper    By Becky Bracken    11 April 2016    Coca Cola wanted to figure out how to recruit and retain the best millennial employees, so it gathered a focus group of employees and listened to what they wanted: paid leave for all employees. Yes, millennials convinced Coca-Cola to offer paid leave for both men and women, and it's a huge step toward gender equality in the workplace that women have needed for decades and that more and more companies are beginning to understand. The new paid-leave-for-all-new-parents benefit will kick in on Jan. 1 2017.    Why is it important for all parents, regardless of gender, to have the opportunity to stay home to take care of new additions to the family? Dads who take parental leave boost equality both in the workplace, because women aren't seen as the sole parent tasked with child rearing, which cuts into their work productivity and advancement. In addition, a father helping out at home balances the load a woman takes on, giving her more time and opportunities at work. It's a beautiful win-win for Coke employees that will hopefully help lead the rest of the workforce to universal paid leave, putting the U.S. on par with the rest of the developed world.    Here's a look at the work of the ""Coca-Cola Millennial Voices"" in action.    But it makes sense. Today, 40 percent of households with kids under 18 have a woman as the primary breadwinner. And, as of 2013, about 70 percent of mothers were in the workforce. To millennials, both men and women, old ideas about gender stereotypes are necessarily giving way to the reality that mom going to work isn't some Mr. Mom hijinks � it's reality, and modern families and modern workplaces are gonna have to adjust.    Just this weekend I was at Target and I saw a dad with his little girl who was about 4 years old walking nearby to their car. When the little girl told her dad she had to go potty, he swung into action like a member of an elite special-ops group. He whipped a potty out of the back of the car, lined it with a Target bag, sat her down, and opened the car door to provide a privacy shield for his little girl. When she was done, he pulled up the bag, tied it and threw it in the trash. It was like a beautifully choreographed ballet. Totally not the way I would have handled it, but it was perfection. That's what I mean. People approach child rearing challenges in a whole different way,  pgNbr=9 and it's fantastic for children to have those experiences with their parents.    Giving both parents paid leave, and the time to do their own parenting thing, is a good thing for their tired, often-working partners and for their kids. Engaged dads live longer, according to a recent study. Because, let's face it, taking care of kids is hard, but it's also a blast. And after taking care of kiddos, you're happy to get back to work.    The millennials finally standing up and working to change the system are doing every family a service, not just their own. And if the reaction from Coca-Cola's Chief People Officer Ceree Eberly is any indication about how employer attitudes about balancing work and family, things are definitely headed in the right direction. ""We think the most successful way to structure benefits to help working families is to make them gender-neutral and encourage both moms and dads to play an active role in their family lives,"" Eberly said.    Can I get an ""Amen!?""    With global businesses like Coca Cola, Google, and Netflix setting an example of how companies can adjust benefit packages to accommodate paid leave for all employees, the rest of the U.S. economy is sure to follow, eventually.

The Coca-Cola Company was one of two companies to partner with the IDB to support development of the tool.    President Moreno's words best sum up the commitment:    ""I am pleased to announce today that we are partnering with the UN Global Compact and UN Women to develop a practical Gender Equality Diagnostic Tool based on the UN Women's Empowerment Principles. This tool allows companies to assess their performance, identify gaps and opportunities, and benchmark their progress against comparative peers.   This tool emerged within the IDB Group, but we are also working in close partnership with The Coca-Cola Company, Itaipu Binacional, KPMG as well as the Governments of Japan and Germany and Business for Social Responsibility. I hope that this tool will complement and build on existing efforts by all the partners to promote gender equality, and will provide an easy first step for those companies that have only begun to think about this so that we can go from principles to action.""    Today, Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) hosted the first consultation to discuss the Tool's development, in which the Company participated. As development progresses we will share the drafts for input.  pgNbr=1 Missy                          pgNbr=2 "

Why Bill Ackman Ought to Buy Warren Buffett a Coke    Fortune    By Jen Wieczner    15 March 2016    T 1TlK *   I'Vff'TV i*/'^""CyP^""OTUOL C*ouo/''*'0 ! '^v'1' SYf' ^ ""S�;*'*'�'^'*'-^-*'^tA^ ^�vt*'AO'\'""/    The performance of each investor's favorite stock today should end their feud.    Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman may need a drink tonight, after his bullish bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals took a devastating turn, with the stock losing more than 51% Tuesday after a hair-raising earnings report. Too bad for him, though, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management most certainly won't be drinking Coca-Cola, whose shares set a new record high during the day.    As adamant as he has been in his support of Valeant, Ackman has publicly declared his distaste for Coke�both the beverage, which he says is too sugary, as well as the stock, which he has sworn off in protest of what he believes are unhealthy products. And he wielded those arguments recently as he lambasted Coca-Cola's largest shareholder, Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway, for owning a company that Ackman says contributes to obesity.    In attacking Berkshire, Ackman was striking back after Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger last year called Valeant ""deeply immoral"" for its practice of raising drug prices, sparking a sort of long-distance feud over whose favorite stock was better. If only Munger and Buffett had bet  pgNbr=2 Ackman a soda in their informal market wager, the investing duo would probably be toasting each other with a couple of Cokes on the hedge fund manager's dime right about now.    While Coca-Cola's stock ended the day just slightly below where it started, it rose to an all-time high of $45.56 in the morning.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKB) has 400 million shares, or a 9.3% stake, in Coca-Cola. American Express (NYSE:AXP), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) are the rest of Berkshire's top four stock holdings.    Coca-Cola shares closed down 0.1% at 45.24 on the stock market today after rising as high as 45.56 earlier. Its stock rose above a first-stage base with a 44.01 buy point on Feb. 22. It's risen about 11% from the low point of the base and was extended far above its 10-week and 200-day averages.    Coca-Cola's earnings per share growth appears poised for a comeback. Growth over the last three quarters has improved from -14% to -8% and -6% last quarter. Wall Street consensus is for the company's EPS this quarter to be flat on a year-over-year basis; it's expected to then return to growth, posting a 3% increase next quarter.    The company on Feb. 18 said that it was raising its quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share from 33 cents, prompting RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi to say in a report that Coke is about to kick off a long-term bull run that could last three to eight years.    Coke joins other consumer stocks, such as McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) and and Ross Stores (NASDAQ:ROST), which are all trading in record high territory.  pgNbr=2 McDonald's rose to a new high close at 124.61 on Feb. 1. On Tuesday, it rose 0.4% to at 123.43.    Home Depot hit a fresh high at 134.74 on Nov. 27 before consolidating. It gained 0.7% Tuesday. Meanwhile, HD Supply (NASDAQ:HDS), a home and building supplies distributor, gapped up as much as 6% after it reported better than expected earnings Tuesday and issued bullish guidance. Shares jumped 4.8% Tuesday.    Domino's Pizza shot up 13% on Feb. 25 to 132.90 after reporting a 27% surge in quarterly EPS. Domino's dipped 1.1% Tuesday.  pgNbr=3 "

""Let me use the example of two good guys: Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. I believe they care    about    climate change. They have no conflict of interest like fossil fuel companies do. Both    signed    a public letter urging strong action on climate in Paris. Pepsi signed two major business    climate action pledges, the Ceres BICEP Climate Declaration in the United States and    the    Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group Trillion Tonne Communique in the UK.    Coca-Cola's website says it will reduce CO emissions by 25% by ""making    comprehensive    carbon footprint reductions across its manufacturing processes, packaging formats,    delivery fleet, refrigeration equipment, and ingredient sourcing."" Coca-Cola says, ""We...    encourag[e] progress in response to climate change."" Indra Nooyi, chair and CEO of    PepsiCo says: ""Combating climate change is absolutely critical to the future of our    company, customers, consumers � and our world. I believe all of us need to take action    now."" - - Sheldon Whitehouse  pgNbr=1 GOVERNMENT    The Climate Movement Needs More Corporate Lobbyists    by Sheldon Whitehouse    Across corporate America, there is broad support for action on climate change. Leading businesses and executives vocally supported President Obama on the Paris Agreement. Many companies have committed themselves to getting onto a sustainable path, and many are pushing their commitment out through their supply chains. This is good, and it's important.  pgNbr=2 But it makes us in Congress feel a little left out. The corporate lobbying presence in Congress is immense. But in my experience, exactly zero of it is dedicated to lobbying for a good, bipartisan climate bill.    Dante wrote that above the Inferno was a sign: ""Abandon hope all ye who enter here."" But there is hope in Congress. Many of my Republican colleagues are eager for some political support, to counter the fossil fuel industry's relentless onslaught.    Despite the statements emitted from oil companies' executive suites about taking climate change seriously and supporting a price on carbon, their lobbying presence in Congress is 100% opposed to any action. In particular, the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade association, is an implacable foe. Given the industry's massive conflict of interest, there is every reason to believe they are playing a double game: trying to buy a little credibility with these public comments while using all their quiet lobbying muscle to crush any threat of bipartisan action on the carbon pricing they claim to espouse.    I am a sponsor of a Senate carbon fee bill, so I know this firsthand. I see their destructive handiwork all around me - and they have no corporate opposition.    Let me use the example of two good guys: Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. I believe they care about climate change. They have no conflict of interest like fossil fuel companies do. Both signed a public letter urging strong action on climate in Paris. Pepsi signed two major business climate action pledges, the Ceres BICEP Climate Declaration in the United States and the Prince of Wales's Corporate Leaders Group Trillion Tonne Communique in the UK.    Coca-Cola's website says it will reduce C02 emissions by 25% by ""making comprehensive carbon footprint reductions across its manufacturing processes, packaging formats, delivery fleet, refrigeration equipment, and ingredient sourcing."" Coca-Cola says, ""We... encourag[e] progress in response to climate change."" Indra Nooyi, chair and CEO of PepsiCo says: ""Combating climate change is absolutely critical to the future of our company, customers, consumers - and our world. I believe all of us need to take action now.""  pgNbr=3 And they are taking action. Their effort puts Coke and Pepsi at the forefront of corporate climate responsibility. But they lobby Congress through a trade association, the American Beverage Association, and through the business lobbying group, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The American Beverage Association sits on the board of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and contributes a lot of money to it.    The American Beverage Association, as far as I can tell, has never lobbied on climate change. When the Association thought Congress might impose a soda tax to fund health care, they lobbied like crazy - nearly $30 million dollars' worth. They know how to lobby, when they want to. But on climate, I've never seen it.    Everyone in Congress knows that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is dead set against Congress doing anything serious about climate change. The U.S. Chamber is very powerful, and its power in Congress is fully dedicated to stopping any serious climate legislation. We see their hostility everywhere.    The result is that Coke and Pepsi take great positions on climate change in their public materials and private actions, but here in Congress their lobbying agencies don't support their position.    No corporate lobbying force is exerted for good on climate change. Mars, maker of the iconic M&M, is going fully carbon neutral. Its climate performance is spectacular. No lobbying. WalMart, America's biggest retailer, is spending tens of millions of dollars to become sustainable. No lobbying. Apple and Google and Facebook are forward-looking, cutting-edge companies of the future, and they lead in sustainability. No lobbying.    The reasoning I am given is always the same. People fear retribution, so embedded is the fossil fuel industry in Congress. The result is the good guys abandoning the field to the worst climate actors in America: the fossil fuel industry and its array of front groups. They don't just lobby. The roughest of these, Americans for Prosperity, boasts loudly that it will spend $750 million in this election (it's already through $400 million and climbing) and that any effort to address climate change will put candidates in ""political peril,"" that they'll be ""at a severe disadvantage."" Subtle like a brick.  pgNbr=4 My response is twofold.    Climate change is not just any other issue. It's so big an issue that the world's leaders just gathered in Paris to address it. It's so big an issue that it has its own page on most corporate websites. It's so big an issue that our former Pacific commander, Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, said it was the biggest national security threat we face in the Pacific Theater. To use his words, climate change ""is probably the most likely thing that is going to happen... that will cripple the security environment, probably more likely than the other scenarios we all often talk about."" So it's big enough for corporations to treat it as more than just another issue in Congress.    Second, they can't hurt you if you organize. An antelope alone may fall to the hyenas, but the herd will protect itself. The fossil fuel industry can't punish Coke and Pepsi and WalMart and Apple and Google and Mars and all the other 100-plus companies who rallied publicly around a strong Paris agreement. You have to stand together.    Around Congress, the bullying menace of the fossil fuel industry is a constant. If the good guys cede the field to them, the result is predictable: members of Congress frozen in place, often against their better judgment. It doesn't have to be this way. I'm in Congress, and I'm writing here to say: we need you guys to show up.    ShClClOn WhltehOUSe is a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island. He is a member of the Environment and    Public Works Committee and the Judiciary Committee, and the author of legislation to put a fee on carbon emissions.

This report provides information about the health, well-being, social environment and health behaviour of 11-, 13- and 15-year-old boys and girls for 42 countries in Europe and North America based on 2013/2014 data. Attached is the background brief of most importance : adolescent's dietary habits.    This report will be leveraged by WHO to influence policy making, ie some of the  pgNbr=1 KPI's of the EU Childhood Obesity Action Plan are based on data from this report.    UNESDA will share later today a reactive media statement. We are also digging into some of the data to explore how we can leverage this report to push for a more holistic view on promoting health rather than a sole focus on sugar and soft drinks.    I would recommend you to download the WHO Europe app which will give you access to a wealth of country specific data, incl. from this report:   J3JJ$�jMll^^    eurooean-health-statistics'idl03385088971S--1 B.nit-:8t?    Below some key findings and messages form the HBSC-report,    Kind regards,    Wouter Vermeulen    The survey report presents a number of positive findings in relation to children and adolescents' health and well-being.    � Life satisfaction is generally high. Eighty per cent of 11-15-year-olds indicate high life satisfaction, but the proportion decreases slightly with age. Differences between boys and girls appear at 13, with boys having higher levels. Life satisfaction is linked to higher family affluence in almost every country in the survey.    � Girls and boys' tobacco and alcohol use has reduced markedly in recent years. Boys are still more likely to smoke and drink alcohol in most countries, but gender differences are decreasing.    � Encouraging trends in risk behaviour are seen. Levels of substance use and fighting have reduced substantially for boys and girls in many countries.    The report nevertheless demonstrates ongoing challenges.    � Girls have poorer mental health. By age 15, 20% of girls perceive their health as fair or poor and 50% experience health complaints more than once a week. Differences with boys increase with age.    � Overweight and obesity is higher among boys, but girls are more likely to think they are too fat. The proportion of girls who think they are too fat increases from 26% at age 11 to 43% at 15. One quarter of 15-year-old girls are on a diet or doing something else to lose weight.    � Eating habits worsen with age. The frequency of breakfast consumption, eating fruit and having family meals decreases between 11 and 15. Only 52% of 15-year-old girls have breakfast every school day and 37% eat fruit daily. For boys, 29% of 15-year-olds eat fruit daily and 22% take soft drinks every day.    � Levels of physical activity remain very low. Only 25% of 11 -year-olds and 16% of those aged 15 meet current guidelines for physical activity. Girls are less likely to achieve the recommended levels.    On obesity:    �     While overweight and obesity remain stable during adolescence or show a slight decrease with age, perceptions of overweight and dieting behaviour increase markedly in girls during this time.    �     Clear gender differences are apparent, with boys tending to be more overweight in most countries and regions.  pgNbr=2 �     Communities, families and individuals need to work together to address this issue. International and national support is needed to protect children and promote health through the provision of healthy and nutritious food, safe neighbourhoods, safe activities and opportunities for physical activity and sports participation    On softdrinks:    �     Soft-drinks consumption has decreased slightly, especially among older adolescents: it is down from 28% for boys and 22% for girls at age 15 in 2009/2010 to 22% and 16% respectively, (note this is base don self-reported data of frequency of daily consumption)    �     Intake of soft drinks among adolescents is a matter of concern and is higher than in other age groups . It is associated with a greater risk of weight gain , obesity and chronic diseases and directly affects dental health by providing excessive amounts of sugars. Determinants of soft-drink consumption include gender, dieting, accessibility and modelling.    �     Food choice is determined by multiple factors, so approaches to improving dietary habits among adolescents must be diverse. Support from policy and practice at environmental, community, family and local levels is necessary, with multisectoral action being important. Policy actions have included food labelling, food-based dietary guidelines, school programmes (vending machines and fruit schemes), salt reduction/reformulation, restriction on marketing of food with high fat, sugar and salt content to children, and taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. Data suggest that the school food environment is also of importance in shaping children's diet.  pgNbr=3 This fact sheet presents highlights from the international report of the 2013/2014 Health Behaviour In School-aged Children (HBSC) survey. HBSC, a WHO coilaborative cross-national study,, asks boys and girls aged 11,13 and 15 years about their health and well-being, social environments and health behaviours every four years. The 2013/2014 survey was conducted in 42 countries and regions across the WHO European Region and North America.    Age differences    Healthy eating behaviours become less common as young people move through adolescence, with the frequency of breakfast consumption, eating fruit and having evening meals with the family decreasing between ages 11 and 15, arid soft-drink consumption increases with ac&    Cross-national and ganclor    Eating a balanced and varied diet and establishing healthy eating habits promotes young people's health, growth and intellectual development across the life-course. Most notably, a healthy diet and body weight reduces the risk of ill health and premature death from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).    A healthy diet can have a significant effect on many of adolescents' main concerns by contributing to maintaining a healthy weight, improving physical and intellectual performance, optimizing growth and improving skin health. An unbalanced diet with a reliance on energy-rich, nutrient-poor foods is an important factor in the current epidemic of obesity and NCDs. WHO guidance to Member States on healthy diets encourages ail people, but particularly adolescents, to eat less food that is high in calories, fats, free sugars or salt/sodium, and more fruit, vegetables and dietary fibre, such as whole grains.    Some diet-related behaviours are particularly important during adolescence. Regularly eating breakfast, for example, is thought to reduce snackincj and consumption of energy-rich foods, it also increases intake of essential micronutrients, including iron, calcium and vitamins C, B and D, and fibre, Skipping breakfast remains very common among young people in Europe, however, and is associated with other unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption and sedentary behaviours.    Some food groups are hugely important during adolescence. Fruit and vegetable consumption during childhood is linked to many positive short- and long-term health outcomes, with a well established decreased risk of NCDs such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and cancer in adulthood. Most countries recommend the consumption of five or more portions (> 400 g) of fruit and vegetables a day, but adolescents in many eat far fewer. Food preferences and eating habits established in adolescence tend to be maintained into adulthood, which makes increasing fruit consumption among children and adolescents an important public health issue.    Eating breakfast is generally more common among boys and varies substantially across countries and regions; from 92% of 11-year-old boys \n the Netherlands to 34% of IS-yea mold qirls lit Albania.    Many inequalities lit eating behaviours exist, with young people from less affluent families generally more likely to report a poorer diet.    Difference between 2010 and 2014    Little change in the low levels of fruit consumption is seen since the previous HBSC survey in 2009/2010.    Soft-drinks consumption has decreased slightly, especially among older adolescents.      pgNbr=4 Certain types of foods and drinks should be limited to special occasions and are not suitable in the context of a healthy diet. Soft-drinks intake is higher among adolescents than in other age groups and is a matter of concern. Soft drinks with added sugar are associated with a greater risk of weight gain,, obesity and chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Research shows that children with the highest intake of sugar-sweetened beverages are more likely to be overweight or obese than those with low intakes. Consumption can also directiy increase the risk of dental caries (commonly known as tooth decay). Sugar-sweetened soft drinks are the main source of free sugars in children and adolescents' diets.    Taking regular meals as a family is associated with healthier diets for adolescents, providing an opportunity for parents to offer healthy choices and present an example of healthy eating.    Healthy eating behaviours become less common as young people move through adolescence, with the frequency of breakfast consumption, eating fruit and having evening meals with the family decreasing between ages 11 and 15.    Soft-drink consumption increases with age, with significant differences between 11- and 15-year-olds found in 23 countries and regions for boys and 16 for girls. Age differences may be attributed, in part, to greater independence in food choice as children grow older.

While they a\Q higher among girls, rates are still relatively low.    Soft-drink consumption is more common among boys at all ages, except among 11-year-olds in Ireland and 13-year-olds in Israel, where girls are more likely to report it. Prevalence ranges from 42% in 15-year-old boys in Greenland to 1% among girls of all ages in Finland. Reported levels are particularly low in Scandinavian countries.    Frequency of having evening meals with the family also shows considerable variation between countries, from 88% of 11-year-old girls in Portugal to 13% of 15-year-old girls in Finland and Poland,    Many inequalities in eating behaviours exist, with young people from less affluent families generally more likely to report a poorer diet. Breakfast and fruit consumption are more common in those from higher-affluence families.    Soft-drink consumption is associated with lower affluence in most countries and regions, but is more common among higher-affluence groups in Albania, Armenia, Estonia, the Republic of Moldova and Romania.    Daily evening meals with the family tend to be more common among young people from higher-affluence families.    Little change in the low levels of fruit consumption is seen since the previous HBSC survey in 2009/2010. Levels of breakfast consumption have also remained steady.    Soft-drinks consumption has decreased slightly, especially among older adolescents: it is down from 28% for boys and 22% for girls at age 15 in 2009/2010 to 22% and 16% respectively.    The WHO European food and nutrition action plan for 2015-2020 envisions a Europe in which the negative impacts of unhealthy diets and obesity in young people have been reduced dramatically.  pgNbr=6 Policies that not only improve consumption of healthy foods like fruit and vegetables among young people, but also influence the production, marketing, availability and aftordabllity of foods rich in saturated fats, trans-fatty acids, free sugars and/or salt, are essential.    Specific actions include:    * adopting easy-to-understand nutritional information about food products, particularly those targeted at children and adolescents;    *  improving knowledge, skills and competence about nutrition and healthy diets by focusing on food literacy and skills in childhood and adolescence;    * cracking down on unhealthy food environments in key settings such as schools, public institutions, catering establishments and retail environments where children and adolescents gather;    � regulating food availability in schools, restricting access to sugary soft drinks and increasing fruit and vegetable    options; � restricting marketing to children and using taxes or subsidies to influence purchasing decisions; and � urgently and massively reformulating food products targeted at children and adolescents.    Successful adoption and implementation of these policies requires continuing emphasis on evidence-based multisectorai approaches. Attention is needed to ensure progress across the process, from development and sharing of good practices, to institutionalized, scaled-up implementation of effective measures.    Investing in children: the European child and adolescent health strategy 2015-2020 highlights the need for sectors to collaborate to facilitate healthier food choices throughout the life-course, it acknowledges that overweight and obesity are among the fastest growing health issues for children and adolescents, creating health problems later in life and producing an economic burden on health systems and societies.

Lublin    A critical factor in how much chief executives are paid isn't how weli their share price performs or how long they run their company, it is who sits at the head of the boardroom table.    CEOs that report to a board run by an independent chairman are paid about 20% less than their peers, according to a new study by proxy advisory firm institutional Shareholder Services.    Such executives made $2.9 million less a year on average than leaders of S&P 500 companies that also serve as chairman or report to a board run by a founder or other company insider, according to the ISS report, which is expected to be released this week.    Variations in board chairmanship account for about 88% of that amount, ISS's analyses of the data show. ""It's accounting for almost all of the difference."" said Carol Bowie. ISS's head of research for the Americas.    Shareholder advocacy groups have spent years pushing companies to separate the jobs of chairman and CEO, reasoning that a company's top manager shouldn't also lead the board that oversees his or her performance and compensation. ISS has supported some of those campaigns but opposed others.    Shareholders have proven largely comfortable with the combined role: They have voted on 372 proposals to separate the roles at S&P 500 companies over the past decade, but approved only about 6%, ISS says,  pgNbr=1 in one high-profile recent fight. Bank of America Corp.'s shareholders last year voted to allow Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan to keep both titles, in the face of opposition from some shareholders and proxy advisory firms, including ISS. Bank of America had no immediate comment.    in the new study, ISS analyzed three years of pay for 484 S&P 500 companies that maintained the same board structure for at least two of the latest three fiscal years.    ISS found that a company's chairman was a bigger factor in CEO pay than the top executive's tenure or the company's recent shareholder return relative to competitors. Only annual revenue, a reflection of company size and complexity, better predicts the scale of CEO pay, the report concludes.    CEOs that aiso serve as chairmen were paid an average of $13.8 million a year over the three-year period, while those reporting to an independent chairman were paid an average of $11 million a year, according to ISS.    The highest-paid leaders were CEOs reporting to a controlling shareholder, founder or other insider. ISS found this group was paid an average of $15.6 million a year.    One is CBS Corp., where founder Sumner Redstone was executive chairman, and which paid CEO Leslie Moonves an average of $62.1 million a year in the three years ending in 2014, according to the company's SEC filings. Mr. Moonves was named chairman in early February after Mr, Redstone retired from the position,    Oracle Corp., where founder and former CEO Larry Ellison is chairman and a major shareholder, paid its CEO an average oi $66.7 million a year in the three years ended May 31, according to the company's latest proxy filing; during most of that time, Mr. Ellison also served as CEO.    CBS and Oracle declined to comment.    CEOs at companies with an inside chairman typically get paid more based on the belief ""they bring greater shareholder returns,"" said George Davis Jr., head of the global CEO practice for recruiters Egon Zehnder. As more companies split the top two roles, he said, ""the gap is going to narrow"" between pay for CEOs with and without independent chairmen.    Among the highly paid chairman-CEGs in the S&P 500 in recent years, based on pay disciosed in their securities filings are Coca-Cola Go.'s Muhtar Kent, who earned an average of $25.4 million in the three years ending In 2014, and AT&T Inc.'s Randall Stephenson, who averaged $23.2 million in compensation in the three years ending in 2014.    A Cooa-Cbia spokesman said the board's iead Independent director, former U.S. Sen. Sam Hunn, leads Mr. Kent's performance evaluation. In its proxy filing, Coca-Cola says the complexity and gBobal scope of the business mean Mr, Kent ""Is in the best position to focus directors' attention on critical business matters and to speak for and lead both the company and the board.""    An AT&T spokesman said the company is ""committed to paying for performance, and Mr. Stephenson's compensation reflects this."" Over the three years, 92% of Mr. Stephenson's target compensation was tied to performance, including stock price, he added.    Combining the top two roles remains highly popular. About 51% of S&P 500 companies combined the CEO and  pgNbr=2 chairman positions as of iast year, down from about 54% in 2014, iSS said.    in comparison, companies with independent chairmen inciude Automatic Data Processing inc., which paid CEO Carlos Rodriguez an average of $7.6 miiiion over the three years ended June 30, and ConAgra Foods Inc., whioh paid former CEO Gary Rodkin an average of $9.4 miilion over the three years ended fvlay 31, the companies' securities filings show.

Russia: Will the Government Release the Gas From the Soda? Rambler (Russian internet news agency), February 26,2016    Last week the discussions continued on the prospects of introduction of excise taxes on palm oil and soft drinks.  pgNbr=1 Earlier it was reported that the Russian government intends to expand the list of excisable products. In particular, this list may end up including palm oil and soft drinks.    The fact that the government is currently considering the matter of introduction, in Russia, of excise taxes on chips, soft drinks, and palm oil, was previously mentioned by the Finance Minister Anton Siluanov. Objections were lodged by the Federal Antimonopoly Service, cautioning on the merits of leaving the choice to the consumers.    A similar concept of taxation was suggested early last week by the deputy from the Spravedlivaya Rossiya party Oleg Mikheev. He reintroduced to the State Duma the bill on implementation of the excise tax, which previously found no support within the government. Introduction of the excise taxes at the rates proposed by Mikheev, according to rough estimates, could lead to retail price increases of 11-19%.    Excise taxes on sweet soft drinks are currently in effect in a number of places, including the Philippines, Mexico, and Vietnam. In Zambia, soft drinks were subject to excise tax for 11 years, but in 2012 the tax was repealed, as it was recognized to be discriminatory against the poor.    According to the industry analysts at Kantar Worldpanel, 63.7% of excise taxes in Mexico have been collected from the poor and the poorest segments of the population, and following the introduction of those excise taxes, more than 30,000 small retail outlets went out of business.    A task force of the Central Institute for Economic Management with the government of Vietnam has assessed the additional revenue from the 10 percent excise tax at $8.46 million, and the losses due to uncollected VAT and tax on profit at $52.6 million.    As Dmitry Petrov, the head of the Russian Union of Soft Drinks Producers, notes, the experience of other countries demonstrates the negative social and economic consequences of introduction of excise taxes on soft drinks. ""Such taxation may result in a reduction in tax revenues at all levels, including VAT and tax on profit. The reduction in demand and the drop in revenue will lead to a need to optimize the production, which will result in reduction of the staff and, as a result, falling revenues from personal income tax. Moreover, considering that the level of localization of production is about 99%, the effect of the market fall will be borne by the domestic enterprises,"" says Mr. Petrov.    It should be noted that if the excise tax on sodas is introduced after all, the measure will also deal a serious blow to the small and medium-sized businesses. In Russia, the sales of soft drinks, especially in the summer, represent a significant part of the proceeds of small businesses specializing in food retail: bakery, grocery, confectionery, etc.    Victor Skachkov, the head of Volchikhinsky Brewery (manufacturer of Buratino and Tarkhun) has admitted that he would be forced to ""kick workers out onto the street."" ""If we just talk, do nothing, and wait, 350 workers at the plant will have to be kicked out onto the street. A bottle of lemonade will cost around 70 rubles. That will be a catastrophe, the end all of it,"" he concluded (quote from Vesti).    Aleksey Chetvergov, General Director of Aqualife, has also commented on the topic: ""An excise tax on sweet soft drinks will first and foremost hit the consumer, in terms of the prices, and the consumer will respond with lower demand, passing on the pain to the producer and further up the chain.""  pgNbr=2 It should be noted that the course selected for our country earlier envisioned the taxation environment remaining unchanged through 2018, with no introduction of additional taxes planned.    However, in the course of the Krasnoyarsk Economic Forum, business representatives expressed their concerns about the stability of the investment climate in our country. In particular, Stefanos Vafeidis, the General Director of Coca-Cola HBC Eurasia, noted the following in his speech: ""As a long-term investor in the Russian economy we believe that transparent and predictable business climate is key to sustainable economic development. Business community salutes the position of the President of Russia who in his annual Assignment to the Parliament confirmed that it's important not to 'worsen the state of taxpayers' by enacting legislation levying new taxes by 2018. We appreciate a dialogue with the Russian government as we continue developing our business and community investments in the country.""    As a reminder, the sum of accumulated investments by the Coca-Cola group in Russia is approximately $4 billion.    To summarize, the advisability of introducing such tax measures out of public health concerns or federal tax revenue considerations is highly doubtful.

Petition organizers argue that corporate sponsorships should not be utilized to ""provide a platform for Trump's dehumanizing hate speech"" and hope to persuade TCCC and other corporations to withdraw support for the Republican National Convention in the event of Mr. Trump's emergence as the Republican nominee. The petition specifically calls upon leadership at TCCC, Xerox, AT&T, Adobe Systems and Cisco to immediately cancel their sponsorships.    During the course of this campaign today, the CoC website has utilized commercial and brand imagery of TCCC properties to highlight its call to action, including doctored images of a Share-A-Coke package and a ""Taste the Feeling"" advertisement. We are actively implementing a comprehensive plan to address concerns raised by these statements. We have consulted with several of our key internal leaders, DC stakeholders, conducted extensive social media analytics and conventional media monitoring, and connected with our consumer center. So far we have had 500 direct consumer contacts but the pace is increasing. On social media, the conversation traffic is low (less than 1%) and does not appear to be an immediate risk for high exposure. However, the conversation includes key influencers in the liberal progressive and African-American social network. So far there has been no conventional media coverage. We will continue to monitor all channels closely. The colorofchange.org petition currently has 52,000 signatories-�70% of their stated goal of 75,000. Once that number is reached, we anticipate some form of outreach to the CEOs, Chief  pgNbr=1 Marketing Officers, and Senior Vice Presidents of Public Affairs at Coca-Cola, Google, Xerox, AT&T, Adobe Systems, and Cisco.    We will engage directly with the Color of Change organization and key external stakeholders to address their concerns and clarify our support for the nominating conventions. We will work with our Corporate Business Resource Groups in ensure we are communicating internally appropriately. The Company's statement is included below for your reference.    The Coca-Cola Company is a nonpartisan business and does not endorse presidential candidates. Through the years, the Company has donated to the local host committees of both parties' political conventions, regardless of the nominees. Our support helps the host committees run these large events and contributes to local economic development but does not represent an endorsement of any specific party or candidate. As a business that operates in every community in America, we believe we have a responsibility to engage in the democratic process.

The smell is unbearable, she says. She gets her daily caffeine fix, and a little extra sugar with it, from Mountain Dew.    Soon, Caldwell might be weaning herself off her trips to the 7-Eleven on 13th and Filbert streets. Mayor Kenney will introduce a tax on sugary beverages as part of his budget this week, according to sources familiar with the matter.    The soda tax, as it is usually called, was a tried-and-failed effort by previous mayor Michael Nutter. But Kenney, who came into office in January with several large and costly ideas including Universal Pre-K, has found that there aren't many streams of revenue available that wouldn't include raising taxes or creating a new tax.    Sources say a soda tax is Kenney's only option to get funding for his ambitious plans. But that won't be enough to convince Philadelphia residents with a sweet tooth.    ""This makes me sad. It's an insane amount of money,"" said Caldwell, 50, who is currently unemployed. ""The city's taking everything away and they don't know how to manage their money. What is the alternative, make your own soda?""    Paul Grant, 52, also felt outraged by the ""terrible"" idea. ""You see the millions spent for the ice rink at City Hall and for Love Park - how is that helping anybody? They could spend less on that instead of raising the price of soda,"" he said.    Speculation that the Kenney administration would take on the soda industry began when the mayor hired Dr. Thomas A. Farley to be the city's health commissioner in early February. Farley, who during his tenure as New York City health commissioner, attempted to ban soda drinks larger than 16 ounces. The city implemented the ban but a New York State appellate court overturned the decision, killing the ban.    Kenney is expected this week to announce details of how much the tax will be, what it applies to and how much money it is expected to generate.  pgNbr=2 Sugary drink taxes typically mean sugar-sweetened beverages, including soda, sports drinks and sweetened ice teas. In Berkeley, Calif., the only U.S. city to impose a soda tax, fruit juice, alcohol and milk-based beverages are not included. Berkeley's levy is one cent per ounce.    Nutter had proposed a tax of two cents per ounce. He emphasized the effects on sugary drinks on obesity as well as the need to fill a budget gap. Kenney would likely champion both the health benefits and the revenue opportunity.    A tax of two cents per ounce would raise a typical 16-ounce soda by 32 cents and bump the price of a 7-Eleven Big Gulp by 64 cents.    Caldwell says if the tax passed, she would buy less Mountain Dew in Philadelphia and stock up when she leaves the city's borders. Grant said he'd find a Costco and start buying in bulk.    The American Beverage Association, a trade association representing America's nonalcoholic beverage industry, has disputed that raising taxes on soda could reduce consumption, saying the higher prices would harm local businesses and burden low-income consumers.    ""The soda tax is an old idea that has been rejected in the past for good reason,"" said ABA spokeswoman Lauren Kane in a statement Sunday afternoon. ""Philadelphians have been burdened year after year with tax increases and a new tax on soda would just be another tax on hard-working Philadelphia residents and neighborhood businesses.    ""Philadelphia's beverage companies have deep roots in the community and provide thousands of good-paying jobs in the city,"" she said. ""We are committed to continuing to work with city leaders to support a strong community that is a great place to live and work for everyone.""    In the U.S., about 10 percent of all obesity- and diabetes-related deaths under age 45 are attributable to sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, according to research by Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Tufts University's school of nutrition science and policy.    Illnesses attributed to sugary drinks also take an economic toll in lost productivity - and because companies and governments skimp on other priorities when they have to spend money on diet-related health care, Mozaffarian said in an article on Tufts' website.    The proposal could make for an interesting fight on City Council, which twice blocked Nutter's attempts to tax sugary drinks. Kenney himself opposed Nutter's proposal. Darrell L. Clarke led that opposition and successfully pulled others to his side.    But Kenney has recruited newly-minted majority leader Councilman Bobby Henon, who during budget negotiations last year was on the verge of proposing the tax himself, to help his cause.  pgNbr=3 ""I get the sense they're looking to to make the determination,"" said a Council source familiar with the conversations. ""If Bobby feels there's even a slight chance , he'll probably move forward with it.""    Insiders say Kenney could have a far better shot than Nutter at getting the tax approved, in part because, just weeks into his term, his relationship with Council is still rosy.    But opposition from lobbyists, who during previous attempts to pass the tax swarmed City Hall, is likely to be fierce. Several of those same faces were seen in the building last week.    ""There's no way they're getting that thing passed,"" said Susan Lin, 37, a regular at Burger King who doesn't drink soda. ""Philadelphia will get all worked up about it even though it could support proposals that would make a difference in the city.""    Lin thinks the tax is a good idea, equivalent to a cigarette tax that will reduce unhealthy habits. ""Now if there were a tax on french fries - then I'd be up in arms,"" she said as she crunched down on another handful of golden fries.

The Street, 3/14/16 - 2:19 PfVS EOT By BjJMUkZMl    Coca-Cola has eclipsed a record that should put a smile on the face of one of its biggest, most prominent shareholders, Warren Buffett.    On Monday, shares of the soft drink giant achieved a record high of $45.35, according to Bloomberg data. Coke's previous all-time high of $44.44 was hit way back in July 1998.

Powered by YC HARTS  pgNbr=1 So far this year, Coca-Cola's stock has gained about 5.5%, outperforming the 1.1% drop for the Dow Jones industrial Average. Over the past year, Coke's stock has tacked on a cool 12.5% versus the Dow's 4.2% decline.    While some on Wall Street may view the rise in Coca-Cola's stock as a function of investors seeking safe-haven investments in a volatile market, there are likely several other more important reasons driving the ascent. That is despite pressured sales of sugary soda, Coca-Cola is being run more efficiently and is seeing pockets of growth outside of its core soda business.    Coca-Cola has been cutting costs through job reductions and unloading some of its bottling operations and factories. In late February, the company said it would refranchise all of its North American bottling operations by the end of 2017, three years ahead of plan, while also refranchising its operations in China. Refranchising will allow Coca-Cola to significantly reduce its capital expenditures and in turn, boost profit margins and return on investment.    In total, Coca-Cola is targeting about $3 billion in annua! savings by 2019.    Meantime, Coca-Cola saw volume increases around the world in several of its top carbonated beverage brands in the fourth quarter, including 1% growth in trademark Coke, 3% in Sprite and 7% for Coke Zero. For non-carbonated beverages, Coke delivered volume gains of 8% in water (Dasani, Smartwater) and 6% in ready-to-drink tea (Honest Tea).    Despite growth slowdowns around the globe, Coke anticipates delivering faster rates of sales and profit gains in 2016 compared to 2015, aided by factors such as demand for smaller cans of soda, cost cuts and stepped-up marketing. Coke is projecting organic revenue, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, to rise 4% to 5% in 2016. In    2015, organic revenue increased 4%.    Profits, excluding one-time items and currency fluctuations, are expected to rise 6% to 8% in    2016, says Coke. For 2015, the measure increased by 6%.    Warren Buffett is likely quite pleased by a more efficient and focused Coca-Cola, which seems to be whetting the appetite of investors. In its latest annual report, Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Coca-Cola last year to 9.3% from 9.2%.    Coca-Cola Nears Record High as Stable Image Gives It Edge: Chart    Bloomberg News    By Jennifer Kaplan  pgNbr=2 March 14, 2016 �12:19 PM EDT    Coca-Cola Co. is trading near record territory - despite a broader market decline - in a sign that investors are seeking safe bets. Though the beverage giant is struggling with declining soda consumption and foreign-exchange headwinds, it's still seen as a reliable source of net income and dividends. And it has the blessing of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Coca-Cola's biggest investor. ""Investors are looking for safety No. 1,"" said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co.

Many of the stories focused on Junior Bridgeman, a successful restaurant franchise owner and former NBA player who is joining the Coca-Cola system. Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution, Coca-Cola Beverages Florida and Swire Coca-Cola, USA also sent out local press releases. Here are some of the highlights from the coverage:    Junior Bridgeman trades restaurants for Coca-Cola Major Wendy's, Chili's franchisee to become a Coca-Cola bottler    Nation's Restaurant News    By Jonathan Maze    http://nrn.CQm/franchisinq/juniQr-bridqeman-trades-restaurants-    Junior Bridgeman is trading his Frosty for a Coke.    The former NBA player who became an even greater success as a Wendy's and Chili's franchisee is selling his restaurant interests after reaching a deal to become a bottler for The  pgNbr=1 Coca-Cola Company, the Atlanta-based soft-drink producer said Wednesday.    According to the release, Bridgeman is in the process of divesting his restaurant holdings, which include about 240 Wendy's locations and 120 Chili's units in 16 states. Bridgeman's restaurant company is based in Louisville, Ky. His bottling operation will also be located there.    The deal would continue a major shift in the ownership of Wendy's locations in particular. Bridgeman would be the second longtime, large-scale operator to sell his locations this year. Earlier this year, Dick Fox, an operator of 113 locations, sold restaurants to three different operators.    In addition, Wendy's continues to refranchise company-owned locations.    Bridgeman played for 12 years in the NBA, mostly with the Milwaukee Bucks. He purchased his first three Wendy's restaurants while still playing basketball, and built on those holdings after he retired in 1987.    Bridgeman, through his company Manna Inc., signed a deal to acquire bottling territory from Atlanta-based Coca-Cola in Missouri, Illinois, Kansas and Nebraska. He will also acquire a production facility in Lenexa, Kan. Manna Inc. will become only the third new independent Coca-Cola bottler in recent decades, the company said.    ###    Bridgeman firm joining Coca-Cola network    Louisville Courier-Journal By Sheldon S.

The news announced by the soft drink company Wednesday comes amid its continued progress in refranchising its North American bottling operations.  pgNbr=2 Bridgeman retired from the National Basketball Association in 1987 and has developed a business portfolio that has made him one of the largest restaurant franchise operators in the country.    Bridgeman is in the process of divesting his restaurant holdings, which include dozens of Wendy's and Chili's franchises, to focus on his future business in the Coca-Cola system, according to a news release from Coca-Cola.    In Louisville, Bridgeman also has a stake in the Mark's Feed Store outlets, Napa River Grill and the new BirraCibo restaurant at 4th Street Live.    Bridgeman has signed a letter of intent to acquire territory from Coca-Cola in Missouri, Illinois, Kansas and Nebraska, including the cities of St. Louis and Kansas City, the release said.    Bridgeman will also acquire a production facility in Lenexa, Kan. Justin Bridgeman, one of his sons, will lead the company with his father.    The new bottling company will become the third new, independent Coca-Cola bottler in recent decades. The others are Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution LLC and Coca-Cola Beverages Florida LLC.    Coca-Cola of Northern New England, which has been part of the Coca-Cola system since 1977, has signed a letter of intent to take on additional territory from the Coca-Cola Company.    ###    Junior Bridgeman shedding restaurants; signs major deal with Coca-Cola    Louisville Business First By David A. Mann    http://www.bizJQurnals.CQm/lQuisville/news/2Q18/Q4/2Q/juniQr-    Restaurant industry veteran and former basketball great Ulysses ""Junior"" Bridgeman is getting out of the Wendy's business and becoming a Coca-Cola bottler.    The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) announced the move today, saying it coincides with its re-franchising of its North American bottling operations.  pgNbr=3 Bridgeman's company, Manna Inc., is the Coca-Cola system's newest bottler, the release said. Bridgeman is a former University of Louisville and Milwaukee Bucks player who established his business interests by purchasing three Wendy's franchises while he was still playing basketball, according to the news release.    Bridgeman retired from the NBA in 1987 and expanded his portfolio of businesses to become one of the largest restaurant franchise operators in the country. He also is one of the highest paid former athletes in the country.    The release says Bridgeman is in the process of divesting his restaurant holdings, which include Wendy's and Chili's franchises, to focus on his future business in the Coca-Cola system.    It's not clear whether that includes some of his smaller restaurant interests, such as the Mark's Feed Store chain, BirraCibo on Fourth Street and Napa River Grill in Westport Village. There also is no indication of who might buy the restaurant operations. I called Bridgeman today, but I haven't heard back.    Bridgeman has signed a letter of intent to acquire territory from The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) in Missouri, Illinois, Kansas and Nebraska, including St. Louis and Kansas City. Bridgeman also will acquire a production facility in Lenexa, Kan.    Justin Bridgeman, one of Junior Bridgeman's sons, will lead the company with his father.    The new bottling company will be only the third new, independent Coca-Cola bottler in recent decades, the release said.

Atlanta-based Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) announced Bridgeman's plans in a press release Wednesday that also announced the planned sale of the Coca-Cola bottling facility on Brown Deer Road in Milwaukee to a distributor based in Rosemont, III. The deal comes two-and-a-half years after Coca-Cola announced a $30 million expansion of the facility. Terms of sale were not disclosed.    With the new distribution deal, Bridgeman will become just the third new independent Coca-Cola bottler in recent decades, Coca-Cola said. Under Bridgeman's letter of intent with the beverage company, he will acquire territory from Coca-Cola Co. in Missouri, Illinois, Kansas and Nebraska, including the cities of St. Louis and Kansas City.    Bridgeman also will acquire a production facility in Lenexa, Kan. He will lead the company along with his son, Justin Bridgeman.    Junior Bridgeman played 12 NBA seasons from 1975 to 1987, including 10 with the Bucks. After retiring, Bridgeman bought five Milwaukee-area Wendy's franchises, and his portfolio added Chili's franchises and has more than 450 restaurants, Forbes estimated in ranking him fourth on its recent list of highest-paid retired athletes.    Coca-Cola Co., based in Atlanta, has been refranchising its North American bottling operations. In addition to the deal with Bridgeman, the company announced expanded territories for three other bottlers, including independent bottler Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution LLC of Rosemont, which is buying the Milwaukee plant.    ###    Coca-Cola plants in Niles, Alsip to be acquired by Reyes Holdings    Chicago Tribune By Greg Trotter    http://www.chicagotribune.CQm/business/ct-CQca-CQla-plants-acqyjre�d.:D42l.:M    Reyes Holdings announced Wednesday plans to acquire Coca-Cola plants in Niles and Alsip, along with four other  pgNbr=5 facilities in the Midwest.    Rosemont-based Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution, a subsidiary of Reyes Holdings, has signed a letter of intent to buy the plants from the Coca-Cola Co. and take over production. The other facilities are in Milwaukee; Detroit; Grand Rapids, Mich.; and Eagan, Minn. Terms of the deal, expected to close by the end of 2017, weren't disclosed.    When asked if the deal would result in layoffs, Meredith Simpson, a Reyes Holdings spokeswoman, said the company doesn't ""expect that there will be any changes to the workforce.""    In January, members of Teamsters Local 727 voted to approve a three-year contract with Coca-Cola, ending contentious negotiations that included a strike that lasted nearly a month. The contract covers 319 production and warehouse workers and transport drivers at the two Illinois plants.    ###    Reyes to buy 6 Coca-Cola production plants    Chicago Sun-Times By Bill Ruminski    http://chicago.suntlmes.com/news/reyes-to-buy-6-coca-cola-production-plants/    Food and beverage distributor Reyes Holdings said Wednesday it intends to buy six production plants from The Coca-Cola Co., including ones in Alsip and Niles.    The deal will be the first foray into bottling by Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution LLC, which is owned by Rosemont-based Reyes Holdings. The other plants are in Detroit and Grand Rapids, Michigan.; Eagan, Minnesota; and Milwaukee.    ""The agreement allows Reyes Holdings and our family of businesses not only to grow our partnership with Coca-Cola, but also to become a producing bottler for the first time,"" Chris Reyes, founder and co-chairman of Reyes Holdings, said in a news release.    Great Lakes Coca-Cola said it expects to complete the purchase in stages by the end of 2017. Financial terms weren't released.    The company acquired the Chicago-area distribution rights for  pgNbr=6 Coca-Cola in 2014 and last fall announced an expansion that eventually will include Michigan, most of Wisconsin, and parts of southern Minnesota, northeast Iowa and northern Illinois.    Reyes Holdings's beverage group is a large beer distributor, working with MillerCoors as well as many craft beers.    ###    Coca-Cola selling Michigan locations to a Chicago distributor    Mlive/Grand Rapids Press By Shandra Martinez    hiip://www^    michigan/index.ssf/2Q16/Q4/coca-    CHICAGO - Two Michigan Coca-Cola distribution centers in Detroit and Grand Rapids will soon have a new owner.    The two locations are among six Midwest production facilities the Coca-Cola Company has signed a letter of intent to sell to the Chicago-area Coca-Cola distributor, Great Lakes Coca-Cola Distribution.    The Michigan locations are at 12225 Oakland Pkwy, Highland Park, in Detroit and at 1440 Butterworth Drive SW, in Grand Rapids,.    The Coca-Cola plant has been located on Grand Rapids' Southwest Side since 1949. The 138,000-square-foot facility underwent a nearly $34 million expansion in 2000, that added a 168,000-square-foot warehouse and distribution center. At the time, the plant employed about a 100 people, according to a Grand Rapids Press story.    The other product facilities are located in Alsip and Niles, III.; Eagan, Minn.; and Milwaukee.    This move marks Rosemont, III.-headquartered Great Lakes' entry into production in the Midwest and further strengthens its partnership with Coca-Cola, the firm said in a statement released Wednesday by Reyes Holdings, owner of Great Lakes.    ""The agreement allows Reyes Holdings and our family of businesses not only to grow our partnership with Coca-Cola, but also to become a producing bottler for the first time,"" Chris  pgNbr=7 Reyes, founder and co-chairman of Reyes Holdings, said in a statement.    The sale of the bottling plants are part of Coca-Cola North America's goal to refranchise its North American bottling operations by 2017.    So far, the beverage giant has reached definitive agreements or signed letters of intent to refranchise territories that account for about half of its bottler-delivered distribution volume in the United States, the company said.    ""We continue to make great progress in refranchising, and these agreements show that our partners are strongly interested in expanding,"" J. Alexander ""Sandy"" Douglas Jr., president of Coca-Cola North America, said in a statement. ""These bottlers are investing in the future of the Coca-Cola system. We are also pleased to welcome a new bottler to the Coca-Cola family.""    Great Lakes previously announced the expansion of its distribution territory across the Midwest in October.    With the closing of those transactions in 2016 and 2017, Great Lakes will have exclusive rights for the sales and distribution of Coca-Cola beverages in Michigan, the majority of Wisconsin, the greater Minneapolis - St. Paul region and portions of northeast Iowa and northern Illinois adjacent to its Chicago territory.    Reyes Holdings is the 12th largest privately-held U.S. company with more than 18,000 employees and annual sales of $24 billion. The company delivers more than 900 million cases of beverage and food products from 142 warehouses in North, Central and South America, as well as Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific.    ###    Hartford Coca-Cola production facility sold    Hartford Business Journal    By Keith Griffin    http://www.harttbrdbusiness.com/aiticle/2016Q420/NEWS01/160^^    Coca-Cola, as part of ongoing strategy to divest itself of company-owned bottling operations across the country, is selling its Hartford production outpost and other New England facilities to a New Hampshire bottler.  pgNbr=8 No financial details of the transaction were released.    New Hampshire's Coca-Cola of Northern New England, which is a franchisee of Coca-Cola, has signed a letter of intent to operate Coke production facilities in several major cities, including Boston, Providence, R.I., and Hartford.    Nationwide, Coca-Cola has reached definitive agreements or signed letters of intent to refranchise production plants that account for approximately 50 percent of bottler-delivered distribution volume in the United States.    ###    New deal pops for Coca-Cola Beverages Florida    Tampa Bay Business Journal    By Margie Manning    http ://w ww .bizj ournals. com/tampab ay /news/2016/04/20/new- deal -    A Tampa Coca-Cola bottler is going to start making the beverages it already sells.    Coca-Cola Beverages Florida has signed a letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) to acquire four production facilities in Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville and Hollywood.    Financial terms were not disclosed in a press release announcing the planned purchase by Coca-Cola Florida, which is already one of the largest private companies and a major employer in the area.    The deal allows Coca-Cola Florida, which markets, sells and distributes Coca-Cola products in central Florida, to deepen its roots in the Sunshine State, Troy Taylor, chairman and CEO, said in the release.    ""These acquisitions will enable us to not only own, but to optimize the process of refreshing Floridians, from production to a cold beverage in hand,"" he said.    The new deal comes on the heels of pending acquisitions of Coca-Cola Co.'s sales and distribution operations in North Florida and in South Florida. The North Florida deal is expected to close this year, with the South Florida operations scheduled for close next year, subject to both sides reaching a definitive agreement.  pgNbr=9 Coca-Cola Florida, organized in early 2014, already is one of the largest independently owned and operated Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States, and had more than $350 million in annual revenue and 1,100 employees, about half of them at the company's headquarters in the Brandon area, Taylor told Tampa Bay Business Journal in an interview last year.    Coca-Cola Co., headquartered in Atlanta, has been refranchising its North American bottling operations. In addition to the deal with Coca-Cola Florida, the company announced a new independent bottler in the Midwest and expanded territories for three other bottlers.    Sales at Coca-Cola Co. fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, Fortune reported, citing a drop in demand as consumers focus on beverages that are viewed as healthy, as well as a strong dollar that's eroding the value of sales outside the United States.    ###    Coke Profit and Revenue Fall as Volume Is Flat    The Wall Street Journal By Anne Steele    http://www.wsj.com/articles/coke-profit-and-revenue-fall-on-flat-volurne-1481152837    Coca-Cola Co. on Wednesday said revenue and profit declined in its latest quarter as soda volume was flat amid weakness abroad.    Shares, up 13% over the past three months, fell 1.8% premarket to $45.77, although results edged in just above Wall Street's expectations.    Coke has been struggling with weakness overseas, with key countries such as Russia and Brazil in recession, consumer demand weak in Europe and Japan, and China's economy slowing. Weakening foreign currencies also are hitting Coke, which generates about half its sales abroad but translates results into dollars.    The company has been able to offset that in part by raising prices and steering consumers to smaller packages that cost more per ounce in its U.S. market.    For the first quarter, Coke reported that its beverage volumes grew 2% both world-wide and in its key North American  pgNbr=10 market.    Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said amid a ""challenging global macro environment,"" the company delivered ""positive top-line growth and strong underlying margin expansion.""    ""We are confident that we have the right strategies in place to achieve our full-year outlook,"" he said.    Noncarbonated drinks, which include tea, packaged water and sports drinks, continued to log strong growth at 7%, driven by solid volume across all key categories except for juice and juice drinks which declined slightly. Soda volumes were even in the quarter globally, and in North America, where growth in Sprite, Fanta and energy drinks was offset by a decline in the namesake Coca-Cola brand.    Overall, Coke posted a profit of $1.48 billion, or 34 cents a share, down from $1.56 billion, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier.    Excluding certain items, per-share earnings were 45 cents, edging in above the 44 cents analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast.    The company said foreign exchange shaved 12 percentage points off its per-share earnings in the quarter.    Revenue fell 4% to $10.28 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast revenue of $10.27 billion. The top line was hurt by one less day compared with the prior-year period.    Also Wednesday, Coke, which has been accelerating the restructuring of its North American operations, outlined more changes to its bottling network.    Ulysses ""Junior"" Bridgeman, a former NBA player and founder of Manna Inc., signed a letter of intent to buy territory from Coke in Missouri, Illinois, Kansas and Nebraska. He will also acquire a production facility in Lenexa, Kan. Bedford, N.H.-based Coca-Cola of Northern New England will take on additional territory from the company throughout New England, acquiring production facilities in Needham Heights, Mass., and Hartford.    The company also said bottlers in Mississippi and Colorado would expand their operations and bottlers in Florida and Chicago would acquire a total of 10 production facilities. Coke  pgNbr=11 also said it plans to grant additional territory rights in Albuquerque, N.M., to Swire Coca-Cola USA.    ###    Just 3rd New Coke Bottler in Decades Being Created --Market Talk    Dow Jones    By Kevin Kingsbury    Ahead of its 1Q report, Coke (KO) said just the 3rd independent bottler ""in recent decades"" will be created as it reaches a deal with former NBA 6th man ""Junior"" Bridgeman, who has gone on to have a reported $400M net worth through becoming a big Wendy's (WEN) franchisee. He is buying bottling territory from KO in 4 midwestern states and a Kansas production facility while selling his restaurant holdings, which include locations of Brinker (EAT)-owned Chili's. KO, which also announces 3 other refranchising deals with current bottlers, comes as the company has been reversing a prior effort to also own its bottling operations.    ###    Coca-Cola Underwhelms Investors Seeking Faster Turnaround    Bloomberg    By Jennifer Kaplan    http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-20/coca-    CQla-prQfit-tQps-estimates-as-new-drink-sizes-bQQSt-sales    Coca-Cola Co. posted first-quarter results that mostly met analysts' expectations, underwhelming investors who'd been optimistic that a stronger turnaround was taking hold.    Earnings were 45 cents a share, excluding some items, the Atlanta-based company said in a statement on Wednesday. Analysts estimated 44 cents, on average. Sales fell 4 percent to $10.3 billion, matching analysts' average projection.    The results show Coca-Cola's strategy of cost cuts and price increases is paying off, just not fast enough for some investors' liking. While Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has made progress by revamping the company's bottling system and starting a $3 billion productivity program, the maker of Diet Coke and Fanta is continuing to struggle with health-conscious consumers' shift away from drinking soda.  pgNbr=12 ""The penny beat on the bottom line is perhaps not as encouraging as one might expect, because you've got some softness on the top line,"" said Vivien Azer, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""We view soda as the new cigarette, which would result in that category, and Coke in particular, realizing structural volume declines from here on out.""    Sales volume for Coca-Cola's sparkling beverages was little changed in the quarter, while noncarbonated beverages gained 7 percent.    Shares of Coca-Cola fell as much as 4.9 percent to $44.30 in New York trading, the biggest intraday decline since August. The stock was up 8.5 percent this year through Tuesday, beating the 2.8 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.    Currency Effects    Coca-Cola is facing currency headwinds abroad and declining soda consumption at home. To combat those trends, the company has introduced smaller bottles and cans that cost more per ounce of liquid than traditional cans and bottles. The efforts have helped somewhat. Coca-Cola's operating margin, excluding currency effects and other items, expanded to 24.8 percent from 23.4 percent. Still, net income fell 4.8 percent to $1.48 billion, or 34 cents a share.    In a bid to improve earnings, Kent has been divesting asset-heavy bottling operations, which lets Coca-Cola focus on the more profitable business of selling concentrates and syrups to the companies that manufacture, package and distribute the drinks. Coca-Cola announced more progress on that front Wednesday, saying it is selling territory to three existing bottlers and one newly formed bottler, led by former National Basketball Association player Ulysses ""Junior"" Bridgeman. To date, the beverage giant has transferred or signed agreements for about two-thirds of company-owned bottling systems.    Coca-Cola, which makes Simply juices and Honest Tea, also is putting a greater focus on noncarbonated drinks. And just ahead of earnings, the company announced a new marketing initiative that will combine all of its namesake sodas into one brand. Coca-Cola Classic, Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Coke Life will be part of the campaign, which will start in Mexico.    ""Things are truly getting better at Coke, and the underlying improvement in fundamentals has created a positive marginal  pgNbr=13 change story, which we think is why the stock has outperformed,"" John Faucher, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a note before the results were released. ""That said, with valuation moving higher and earnings likely flat to down until the back half of 2017 as a result of the bottler refranchising, we see limited room for further upside from here.""  pgNbr=14 "

This document also includes some information about US beverage tax  pgNbr=1 trends and addresses many of the misperceptions people have about these taxes.    Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for this document. We will continue to update it as the situation in Philadelphia develops.    Thanks, Ben      pgNbr=2 Philadelphia Beverage Tax Background and TCCC Position    Beverage Tax Background:    Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney introduced a 3-cent per ounce tax on beverages with sugar. The tax was positioned as a critical need in order to pay for universal Pre-K and other investments in schools and parks and recreation. Some media and industry critics argue this tax reflects a ""tipping point"" within our culture and the nation regarding soft drinks. However, the facts and history of beverage taxes show a different picture. Despite rejecting a tax on beverages with sugar twice in the last eight years, Philadelphia's City Council has advanced a proposal to tax beverages with sugar and ""artificially sweetened drinks"" at 1.5 cents per ounce. The Council is expected to approve the tax and the Mayor will sign it before July 1, 2016. However, the local coalition continues working to stop the tax from achieving final passage.    In the moments before the tax was approved, the administration revealed that most of the funds from the tax would not fund programs like Pre-K until three years from now. Instead, the bulk of the money will go to pay the general fund balance. Although the trend in the US in the last decade has been the rejection of beverage taxes, the recent passage of taxes in Berkeley, CA and now in Philadelphia are controversial exceptions.    TCCC's Philadelphia Tax Position:    TCCC opposes the Philadelphia tax proposal because it unfairly targets one product, disproportionately impacts low-income and elderly communities and hurts small businesses. Singling out one product category, like nonalcoholic beverages, is an unreliable way to fund important local initiatives like Pre-K education.    If collecting money is the goal, which is the case in Philadelphia, in order to collect the money and avoid altering industries, the most effective way is to broaden the base or use existing taxes. We know that governments need resources but discriminatory taxes are not the solution.    While the tax has been approved by City Council's Committee of the Whole, we will continue working with local Philadelphia restaurants, grocers, small businesses, citizens and beverage companies to oppose this regressive tax. Together with our coalition partners, we are exploring all options and will make an announcement about our next steps soon.    Background on Beverage Taxes:    There are fewer soft drink/beverage taxes in the US today than in recent history.    �  Many state beverage excise taxes (e.g. Ohio, New York, North Carolina and South Carolina) were on the books for decades, but repealed in late 1980s-1990s.    �  Only two states currently have taxes on soft drinks: Arkansas (enacted 1992) and West Virginia (enacted 1951). Both states rank among the highest in the nation for obesity.    �  Many states impose sales taxes on foods and beverages, and our Company does not oppose these types of broad-based taxes.    US cities and states have consistently rejected new tax proposals.    �  In the last eight years, 43 out of 44 different tax proposals have been rejected.    �  The only recent tax to pass was in Berkeley, CA.    �  Polling data showed 58 percent of Philadelphians oppose a tax on beverages.    �  These taxes are consistently rejected because the public opposes them. A Harris Poll found that nationally, 62 percent of Americans oppose these taxes.    Sales taxes are not ""beverage taxes"".    �  There's a difference between sales taxes and excise taxes. Many states apply sales taxes to all foods and beverages and is based on a percentage of what you buy. Excise taxes target one specific item and are often a flat rate owed on top of what you buy.    �  TCCC does not oppose sales taxes on our products because they are applied fairly across most other food and beverage items found in grocery stores and restaurants.  pgNbr=3 �  If collecting money is the goal, which is the case in Philadelphia, in order to collect the money and avoid altering industries, the most effective way is to broaden the base or use existing taxes. We know that governments need resources, but discriminatory taxes are not the solution.    ""Big Soda"" is not the only opposition to beverage taxes.    �  TCCC, its competitors, and the American Beverage Association support and organize efforts to oppose beverage taxes.    �  Local, small businesses and citizens voluntarily join our efforts to form coalitions. For example, in Philadelphia, the local coalition included 1400 businesses and 25,000 individuals.    �  Coalitions include real, local businesses and people who take action on their own - often at putting their reputation and business at risk.    �  Local coalitions do the bulk of the work to oppose taxes: send letters, make phone calls, talk to media and attend rallies - all to protect their jobs, businesses and grocery bills.    �  Local voices from grocers, retailers, restaurants, organized labor and citizens are much more effective in advocating against beverage taxes.    �  City council members and state legislators care a lot more about the impact of a tax on their local constituents than on a multinational beverage company.    Q&A:    When is the City Council expected to vote on the tax?    We expect the full council to vote on the bill June 16, 2016.    When would the tax be effective?    We expect it would be effective on January 1, 2017.    Who would pay the tax?    The tax is applied at the distributor level. As a result, customers and consumers can expect to pay higher prices for beverages.    Would the tax apply to diets?    Yes, ""artificially sweetened"" beverages are included.    If passed, will the tax apply to fountain?    Yes on finished product, at 1.5-cents per ounce.  pgNbr=4 "
