This letter Is being sent to even/ entity in Ihe United Slates registered wilh the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to manufacture or distribute controlled substances. The purpose of this lelter Is to reiterate the responsibilities of controlled substance manufacturers and distributors to inform DEA of suspicious orders In accordance wilh 21 CFR 1301.74(b).    In addilion to, and not in lieu of, the general requirement under 21 USC 823, that manufacturers and distributors maintain effective controls against diversion. DEA regulations require all manufacturers and distributors to report suspicious orders of controlled substances. Tills 21 CFR 1301.74(b), specifically requires that s registrant ""design and operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances."" The regulation clearly indicates that It Is tha sole responsibility of the registrant to design and operate such a system. Accordingly, DEA does not approve or otherwise endorse any specific system for reporting suspicious orders. Past communications with DEA. whether implicit or explicit, that could be construed as approval of a particular system for reporting suspicious orders, should no longer be taken to mean that DEA approves a specific system.    The regulation also requires that the registrant Inform the local DEA Division Office of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrant. Filing a monlhly report ol completed transactions (e.g.. ""excessive purchase report"" or ""high unit purchases') does nol meet the regulatory requirement lo report suspicious orders, Registrants are reminded that their responsibility doss not end merely with the filing of a suspicious order report Registrants must conduct an independent analysis of suspicious orders prior to completing a sala to determine whether Ihe controlled substances are likely to be diverted from legitimate channels. Reporting an order as suspicious will not absolve tha registrant of responsibility if the registrant knew, or should have known, that the controlled substances were being diverted.    The regulation specifically slates that suspicious orders include orders of an unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of an unusual frequency. These criteria are disjunctive and are nol all Inclusive. For example, if an order deviates subslanlially from a normal pallorn, the size of the order does not matter and tha order should be reported as suspicious. Likewise, a registrant need not welt for a ""normal pattern"" to develop over time before determining whether a particular order Is suspicious. The size of an order alone, whether or nol It deviates from a normal pattern, Is enough to trigger the registrant's responsibility to report the order ss suspicious, The determination of whether an order is suspicious depends not only on the ordering patterns of the particular customer, but also on the patterns of the registrant's customer base and the patterns throughout tha relevant segment of the regulated industry.    Failure to maintain effective controls against diversion is inconsistent with the public interest and may result in the revocation of the registrant's DEA license    DEA can immediately    suspend or revoke    registration for violations of    the Controlled Substances    Act and regulations.

PagelD #: 127769    DEA Florida Pain Clinic Raids    Florida Sun Sentinel    3:54 p.m. EST. February 23. 2011    Drug investigators raided an untold number of pain clinics from Miami to West Palm Beach on Wednesday,    arresting doctors and clinic owners in the biggest single strike at Florida's pain pill industry. Hundreds of officers from federal, state and local agencies fanned out in an orchestrated sweep that shut down    some of the busiest and best known pain clinics in Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties, said    officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In Delrav Beach, police arrested Dr. Zvi Harry Perper, the son of Broward Medical Examiner Dr. Joshua Perper, at    Delray Pain Management, 201 N. Swinton Ave. Zvi Perper is listed as the owner of the clinic, which is run by    manager Kenneth Murry, who opened it in early 2009. In Oakland Park, a half dozen medical personnel in scrubs were handcuffed and arrested at a high-volume clinic    called Commercial Medical Group, 291 E. Commercial Blvd. Arrests also were made at by agents raiding 45th Street Medical in Lake Worth, which is owned by Dr. Robert    Elessar, federal officials said. Agents raided many more locations, seizing records as part of ongoing    investigations. ""We're so happy all this is happening,"" said Julie DePasquale, a clerk at German Bread Haus two doors from the    Oakland Park clinic. She said it is popularwith out-of-state pill seekers. ""I'll feel safer coming to work at 7    o'clock in the morning. The druggies are out there like the night of the living dead, waiting for that place to    open. It's scary."" The raids were led by agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the Broward Sheriffs Office, the    Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office and police departments from the state and cities. Florida Department of    Health inspectors were on hand to initiate disciplinary actions against clinic doctors and owners.

Not if you're not licensed   18   appropriately.   19        Q.   Not licensed. And what Congress has   20   done is it created licensed manufacturers,   21   correct?   22              MS.

Is that Cardinal's understanding?   7        A.   Correct.   8        Q.   Prior to the enactment or the rendering   9   of this Masters Pharmaceutical opinion, when you   10   mentioned there was a shipping requirement   11   Cardinal believes it had, how far back did that   12   same shipping requirement go?   13        A.   Back to approximately 2007.   14        Q.   We're going to baby step this, okay? So   15   bear with me.   16        A.   Okay.   17        Q.   So from approximately some point in   18   2007, Cardinal believes it had the shipping   19  requirement that's set out in the Masters 2 o Pharmaceutical case applicable to them?   21        A.   Approximately, because obviously I think   22   we'll get there. The Dear Registrant letters   23   started coming out. So approximately that time   24  period.    Page 127   1        Q.   Prior to 2000� prior to the rendering   2   of the Masters Pharmaceutical case, did Cardinal   3   have a shipping requirement?   4        A.   Yes.   5        Q.   How far back does Cardinal take the   6  position that this shipping � strike that.   7             Prior to 2017 and the rendering of this   8   Masters Pharmaceutical opinion, does Cardinal   9   believe its shipping requirement was the same as   10   outlined here in the Masters Pharmaceutical case?   11        A.   Generally, yes.   12        Q.   Okay. So as it relates to � and we're   13   not going to talk necessarily about how far back   14   it goes yet.   15             So we have an understanding, the   16   shipping requirement gives you two choices,   17   correct?   18        A.   As it's laid out here, yes.   19        Q.   And you agree � Cardinal agrees with 2 o that, correct?   24       A.   Yes.   22        Q.   Okay. The first choice is you can   23   decline the ship? You can cut the order as   24   Cardinal uses the phrase, correct?   Page 129   1        Q.   So since 2007 or approximately that time   2   period, Cardinal has not shipped suspicious   3   orders, correct?   4        A.   Since 2007, Cardinal Health has not   5   shipped an order that it has reported as   6   suspicious to the DEA.   7        Q.   And since 2007, Cardinal has not shipped   8   a suspicious order that it hasn't determined �   9   that it hasn't done the due diligence on to   10 determine it's not going to be diverted, correct? 44            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   12        A.   Since approximately 2007, Cardinal   13   Health has not shipped an order it has reported as   14   suspicious to the DEA.   15        Q.   Okay. So how many orders since 2007 �   16  how many suspicious orders has Cardinal shipped   17   that it failed to report to the DEA �   7 8            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form. 7 9       Q.   -since 2007?   20        A.   None to Cardinal Health's knowledge.   21        Q.   Prior to 2007, was Cardinal shipping   22   suspicious orders?   23        A.   Prior to its understanding from the DEA   24   of the obligation, the change, the sea change in    Golkow Litigation Services    Page: 33 (126 - 129)     Case\&%^-&�Qfc$�RtQg$ #1 1�&J^CE'I<&> W^%tt&&\-d%m}8ft-\&S&&    lew    Page 130      Page 132    1 the obligation to suddenly � suddenly maybe is   l   comply with that required the reporting of    2  the wrong word � to not �   2   suspicious orders, correct?    3       Q.   I mean, suddenly is good for you.   3   A.   Cardinal understood the language of the    4       A.   � to not ship pursuant to the guidance   4   statute �    5 by the DEA, it was a report only period. Cardinal   5   Q.   Hold on. Hold on. I'm not �    6 Health made the reports as required by the DEA.   6   MS. MAINIGI: Let her finish. Let her    7       Q.   So prior to 2007, Cardinal was shipping   7   finish.    8  suspicious orders? Well, strike that. Let me   8   MR. FULLER: Okay.    9 back up.   9   BY MR. FULLER:    10            Prior to this approximate time frame of   10   Q.   Sorry. Go ahead.    11 2007, which we have yet to nail down, Cardinal was   11   A.   Cardinal Health understood the language    12  shipping orders that it reported as suspicious?   12   of the statute and the guidance we received from    13       A.   During the time period prior to 2007,   13   the DEA and was making the reports accordingly.    14 Cardinal Health's obligation was to report only.   14   Q.   So my question is, did Cardinal file    15       Q.   Yes, ma'am. I got that. But my   15   suspicious order reports prior to approximately    16 question is, prior to this approximate 2007 time   16   2007?    17 frame, Cardinal was shipping suspicious orders   17   MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.    18  after it reported � well, strike that. Let me   18   A.   I don't know that that's what they were    19  ask it differently.   19   calling them at that time. Again, we filed per    20            Prior to 2007, do you know whether   20   the DEA's guidance ingredient limit reports,    2 7 Cardinal was reporting and then shipping   21   excessive order reports.    22  suspicious orders or shipping suspicious orders   22   Q.   So prior to 2007 � so prior to 2007,    23  and then reporting?   23   Cardinal was knowingly shipping orders that it    24            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   24   knew qualified as suspicious under the regulation,    Page 131      Page 133    1 Objection; time period.   1   correct?    2            Go ahead.   2   MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.    3       A.   In accordance from the guidance we   3   Objection; time period.    4 received from the DEA, Cardinal Health was making   4   A.   No, not necessarily.    5 the reports as required by the DEA, the ingredient   5   Q.   What you've told us � and see if I    6 limit reports and the excessive order reports, and   6   understand it correctly.    7 it was shipping orders in accordance with the   7   You told us that prior to 2007, Cardinal    8 guidelines from the DEA. If pursuant to one of   8   only had a reporting requirement according to    9 those excessive order reports the DEA said ""Do not   9   Cardinal, correct?    10  ship,"" we did not ship.   10   A.   According to Cardinal and others, yes.    11       Q.   You mentioned excessive order reports   11   Q.   And, therefore, Cardinal believes it was    12  and some other type of reports.   12   doing what it was supposed to do in reporting    13       A.   Ingredient limit reports.   13   suspicious orders, but it was still shipping    14       Q.   Was Cardinal actually reporting   14   suspicious orders, correct?    15  suspicious orders prior to this time period in   15   A.   Cardinal Health was doing what it was    76 2007?   16   directed to do by the DEA.    77            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; time period.   17   Q.   So I'm just asking, during this time    7 8            Go ahead.   18   frame prior to 2007, did Cardinal report orders as    19       A.   As required by the DEA, we were   19   potentially suspicious or suspicious orders and    2 o  submitting the ingredient limit reports pursuant   20   then still send the shipments out?    2 7 to the guidance we received, as well as the   21   MS. MAINIGI: Objection; time period.    22  excessive order reports.   22   A.   Yes. That is the direction we received    23       Q.   But during this time prior to 2007,   23   from the DEA. We made the reports as required,    24 Cardinal knew that it had a rale that it had to   24   and there was not a shipping requirement.

Now, just so I understand, what is an �   1   BY MR. FULLER:    2  you said ""an excessive order report."" What is   2   Q.   Would you agree with that?    3  that?   3   A.   I would agree with that.    4       A.   Within the distribution centers, the   4   Q.   Okay. Now, conversely, when we say    5 folks that are picking the orders have the ability   5   ""reporting requirement,"" we don't mean not report?    6 to identify an order of a new rule, size, pattern,   6   A.   Correct.    7 or frequency, and raise their hand, so to speak,   7   Q.   Okay.    8 to identify that order, and in doing so, during   8   A.   We can blame Masters.    9 this time period, we were submitting those to the   9   Q.   Tell me what Cardinal's position �    10 DEA as excessive order reports.   10   strike that.    11       Q.   Would they be submitted order by order,   11   So it's Cardinal's position that the    12  or was it a compilation of things that occurred   12   first time they were informed of a potential    13  over a period of time?   13   shipping requirement was in Rannazzisi's 2006    14       A.   My understanding is order by order.   14   letter that was sent to all the distributors in    15       Q.   And what's an ingredient limit report?   15   the industry?    16       A.   An ingredient limit report is the report   16   A.   Yes.    17 that was required pursuant to the 1998 DEA report   17   Q.   Cardinal also had meetings with the DEA    18 to, I believe, the Attorney General. It included   18   around this time frame as well, correct?    19 the algorithm for certain pharmaceuticals, and we   19   A.   Yes.    20 on a monthly basis provided the report of the   20   Q.   When is the first meeting that Cardinal    2 7 customers who had exceeded the designated amount   21   had with the DEA?    22  that you achieve pursuant to doing the algorithm,   22   MS.

Any time prior to this that you're aware    Page 135      Page 137    1 correct?   1   of.    2       A.   I believe so. I'm not � I'm actually   2   A.   Prior to the receipt of the first    3  not positive.   3   Rannazzisi letter?    4       Q.   So does Cardinal believe � well, let's   4   Q.   Yes, ma'am.    5 try to nail down this time frame in 2007 first,   5   A.   I know we had a meeting with the DEA    6 okay?   6   regarding Internet pharmacies in 2005, but not    7       A.   Okay.   7   with � not the subject of what ultimately came    8       Q.   What is its � what is Cardinal's   8   out in the Rannazzisi letter.    9 position as to � strike that.   9   Q.   Well, then let's backstep that. There    10            Is it Cardinal's position or   10   was actually a meeting with Cardinal and the DEA    11 understanding that the initial Rannazzisi letter   11   in approximately August of 2005; is that correct?    12  in 2006 informed them of a shipping requirement as   12   A.   I believe that's the time frame, yes.    13  we've described it?   13   Q.   And this meeting included concerns    14       A.   Yes. That was the first communication   14   related to the Controlled Substances Act and the    15 Cardinal received regarding this sea change of   15   distribution of controlled substances, correct?    16  adding a shipping requirement to the obligations.   16   MS.

I know the meeting � the topic of the    18 clarification, because when you see the phrase   18   meeting was Internet pharmacies.

Was there any further communication   11   A.   Yes. It appears to be the document I've    12 between Cardinal Health and the DEA between   12   reviewed.    13  September of '06 and December of '07 when the   13   Q.

Part of the design is to ensure that   16   reasonable steps to ensure that their registration    17 there are effective controls against diversion.   17   is not being utilized as a source of diversion?    18       Q.   To prevent diversion, right?   18   A.   Cardinal Health has an obligation to    19       A.   To maintain �   19   comply with the statute, the regulations, the law    28            MS.

And does that mean they have to take    23       A.   To maintain effective controls against   23   steps to prevent their registration from being    24 diversion, yes.   24   used as a source of diversion; yes or no?

That is guidance provided by the DEA.   2        Q.   So being that this letter is guidance   3   provided by the DEA, then the answer is yes,   4   Cardinal has to take steps to prevent its   5   registration from being used as a source of   6   diversion, correct?   7        A.   Generally, yes.   8        Q.   Generally, yes, or yes?   9        A.   Generally, yes, in accordance with the   10   statute, the regulations, and the guidance   11   provided by the DEA.   12        Q.   Well, you've told me that several times.   13   And then I asked the follow-up, being that this   14   letter is guidance from the DEA, you would agree   15   with that, correct?   16        A.   Um-hmm, yes.   17        Q.   Cardinal agrees that this September 27,   18   2006 letter provided by Rannazzisi, who was at the   19   DEA, is providing guidance to the wholesale 2 o distributor industry, correct?   21        A.   Correct.   22        Q.   Okay. And as part of that guidance,   23   he's telling wholesale distributors, including   24   Cardinal, that they need to take steps to prevent   Page 152   1   vigilant in deciding whether a prospective   2   customer can be trusted to deliver controlled   3   substances only for lawful purposes; correct?   4              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   5        A.   In maintaining effective controls   6   against diversion, yes.   7        Q.   So if Cardinal has a basis or a reason   8   for knowing a customer of theirs, a drugstore or   9   pharmacy, may be obtaining controlled substances   10   for an unlawful purpose, Cardinal has an   11   obligation not to participate in that scheme,   12   correct?   43            MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   14        A.   If Cardinal Health is aware that a   15   customer is doing that, Cardinal Health would not   16   sell to that customer.   17        Q.   Now, let me ask you, as it relates to   18   Cardinal's obligation, does Cardinal actually have   19   to be aware of actual diversion by the drugstore   2 o or pharmacy or the potential for diversion by that   21   drugstore or pharmacy?   22              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; scope.   23        A.   What obligation are you referring to?   24        Q.   The obligation where it's going to sell    Page 151   1   the registration from being used as a source of   2   diversion; yes or no?   3        A.   Yes, that is the guidance provided in   4   this letter.   5        Q.   Fair enough. Thank you. Read the rest   6   of that paragraph for me, please.   7        A.   ""Distributors are, of course, one of the   8   key components in the distribution chain. If the   9   closed system is to function properly, as Congress   10   envisioned, distributors must be vigilant in   11   deciding whether a prospective customer can be   12   trusted to deliver controlled substances only for   13   lawful purposes.""   14              ""This responsibility is critical as   15   Congress has expressly declared that the illegal   16   distribution of controlled substances has a   17   substantial and detrimental effect on the health   18   and general welfare of the American people.""   19        Q.   And Cardinal agrees and accepts that   2 o distributors are one of the key components in the   21   distribution chain; is that right?   22              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   23        A.   Yes.   24        Q.   And that the distributors must be   Page 153   1   those drugs to that pharmacy.   2              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form and scope.   3        A.   Under the statute, Cardinal has an   4   obligation to identify and report suspicious   5   orders, and then under the additional guidance   6   provided by the DEA, the further obligation to not   7   ship those orders that it has reported as   8   suspicious.   9        Q.   And as we talked earlier, Cardinal has   10   an affirmative obligation to maintain effective   11   controls against diversion, correct?   12        A.   Correct.   13        Q.   That's separate from the suspicious   14   order regulation; isn't that true?   15        A.   Correct.   16        Q.   So in order to �   17        A.   Not completely separate, but yes.   18        Q.   It's in the Controlled Substances Act, I   19   will give you that. 28       A.   Yes.   21        Q.   And the Controlled Substances Act   22   spawned the regulation created by the DEA for   23   suspicious orders, fair enough?   24        A.   Yes.

So the requirement to maintain   i   A.   If they pose an unreasonable risk of    2 effective controls against diversion means we have   2   diversion or we know they are diverting, Cardinal    3 to try to prevent diversion; is that correct?   3   Health will not sell to them.    4            MS.

Is it a reasonable belief or   18   -----    19 we know they're diverting?

Ms. Norris, have you ever seen this    3 pharmacy or a drugstore, it has the affirmative   3   document before?    4 obligation to not sell opioids to that drugstore,   4   A.

The Knowing Your Customer is a component    18 see ""Key Takeaways""?   18   of our anti-diversion program.    7 9       A.   Yes.   19   Q.   And as you testified to earlier, even    20       Q.   And, there again, in this summary from   20   prior to that program going into place, you still    2 7 HDMA being provided to its members is again the   21   would take steps to know the customer; is that    22 DEA's position on suspicious orders and that they   22   fair?    23 have a stop shipment or a due diligence   23   A.   We've always had the anti-diversion    24 requirement, correct? I'm sorry. It's under the   24   program, the suspicious order monitoring program.

And I'm still taken aback.   4              Based on when Cardinal became informed   5   of this shipping requirement by the DEA, sitting   6   here today, you can't tell us when they took any   7   action in that regard, correct? Actually, let's   8   backstep it.   9              The policies and procedures that were   10   entered into in the latter part of '08 � we   11   looked at some of them earlier, right, December of   12   '08?   13        A.   Mm-hmm.   14        Q.   Do you remember that? 75       A.   Yes.   16        Q.   Okay. Some of those, I believe � and   17   correct me if I'm wrong � include a shipping   18   requirement; do they not?   19        A.   The policy that we looked at mentions 2 o held orders.   21        Q.   So we know at least two years after   22   Cardinal was aware of the shipping requirement,   23   they did something, right?   24              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; form.   Page 300   1        A.   I don't recall specifically.   2        Q.   So sitting here today, you don't know if   3   there was a shipping requirement in 2007, correct?   4             MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   5   Misstates her testimony.   6        A.   My understanding is our suspicious order   7   monitoring system, including the shipping   8   requirement, was implemented in late 2007.   9        Q.   Well, just a minute ago you couldn't   10   tell me when y'all first did something in relation   11   to the new shipping requirement.   12             Wasn't that your testimony?   43            MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   14   Misstates her testimony.   15        A.   I don't believe so. I believe we were   16   talking about the period between 2006 and 2000�   17   the receipt of the first letter and when we did   18   implement. We never established when we   19   implemented.   20        Q.   So you believe that you implemented a   2 7 policy and procedure for the shipping requirement   22   in late 2007?   23             MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   24        A.   We initiated our suspicious order    Page 299   1        Q.   September of '06 to December of '08. I   2   was giving you the benefit of the doubt. It's   3   actually 26 months, a little over two years,   4   correct?   5        A.   We have a policy dated 2008 that   6   mentions held orders. It does not � it does not   7   make a statement about prior time period.   8        Q.   And sitting here today, can you tell the   9  jury if Cardinal did anything prior to that policy   10   related to what Cardinal considers new obligation   11   as far as shipping requirement?   12              MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   13        A.   Yes. Our anti-diversion program was   14   implemented � anti-diversion system, suspicious   15   order monitoring system, was implemented in late 76 2007.   17        Q.   And did it include a shipping   18   requirement? 7 9       A.   Yes.   20       Q.   And where is the policy that   2 7 specifically provides the shipping requirement?   22        A.   I don't have a copy of that particular   23   policy.   24        Q.   Did you review it?   Page 301   1   monitoring system in late 2007. I cannot speak to   2   policies and procedures.   3        Q.   Okay. Fair enough. Who is Dendright?   4        A.   Dendright?   5        Q.   Yes, ma'am.   6        A.   My understanding is that Dendright is a   7   third party we engaged to perform, I believe, site   8   visits.   9                                     ____   10         (Cardinal-Norris Exhibit 33 marked.)   n                        ___   12              MR.

I can't remember if it's Dendright.   7   Ms. Norris is just going to clarify so that it's    8       Q.   But at least apparently in 2008, it was   8   clear.    9 Dendright?   9   BY MR.

So I'll ask the question again.   17   Did Cardinal have in place a system for reporting   18   all suspicious orders prior to 2007? 7 9       A.   Yes.   20                                     ____   2 7         (Cardinal-Norris Exhibit 34 marked.)   22                                     ____   23        Q.   Now, as Norris 19, I'm going to pass you   24   what has been marked as Plaintiffs 34. And I'm   Page 308   1   this topic, you mentioned two reports when you   2   talked about the prior to '07 suspicious order   3   reporting, the ingredient �   4        A.   The ingredient limit report.   5         Q.   And then another one.   6        A.   Excessive order reports.   7         Q.   Where would I find those reports?   8        A.   My understanding is that some of them   9   have been produced.   10         Q.   And where does Cardinal keep those   11   reports?   12              MS. MAINIGI: Objection; outside the   13   scope.   14         Q.   Are they electronic reports? I think   15   you testified earlier they were.   16              MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   17        A.   No, I didn't testify that those were   18   electronic. I � the reports I have seen appear   19   to be facsimiles, faxes, that were sent back and   20   forth. So I guess maybe that's electronic.   21         Q.   Are they handwritten?   22         A.   It's a form that's filled out with   23   handwriting on it, yes.   24              MS. MAINIGI: I believe Ms. Norris    Page 307   1   willing to bet you've looked at this before today.   2        A.   Yes.   3        Q.   Does that appear to be a true and   4   accurate copy of the Memorandum of Agreement   5   between the United States Department of Justice,   6   the DEA, and Cardinal Health?   7        A.   Yes. It's not the fully executed copy,   8   but...   9        Q.   And if you turn to page 2 of that 10 document.   44       A.   Yes.   12        Q.   Do you see there in the first paragraph,   13   ""Cardinal admits that its due diligence efforts   14   for some pharmacy customers and its compliance   15   with the 2008 MOA in certain respects were   16   inadequate."" 47            Correct?   18        A.   I see that language, yes.   19        Q.   Does Cardinal agree with that?   20        A.   ""Cardinal agrees that its due diligence   2 7 efforts for some pharmacy customers in certain   22   respects were inadequate and thus its compliance   23   with the 2008 MOA.""   24        Q.   Oh, and then we � before we finish with   Page 309   1   referred you to Exhibit 20, which is a policy that   2   contains reference to them.   3              MR. FULLER: Thank you.   4   BY MR. FULLER:   5        Q.   Okay. So I believe � and I may be   6   wrong, but I believe earlier you testified that   7   those were electronic reports.   8              Are you now saying they are not   9   electronic reports?   48            MS. MAINIGI: Objection to form.   11        A.   The ingredient limit report is prepared   12   electronically. The excessive order reports are   13   filled out when one comes up and sent to the DEA.   14        Q.   So that's a system that's done manually,   15   correct?   16        A.   Yes. These are the orders that are   17   identified in the distribution center as the folks   18   are picking them.   19        Q.   And based on the � now I'm switching   20   back gears to Exhibit 34. 24       A.   Okay.   22        Q.   All right. So based on this Memorandum   23   of Understanding entered in 2012, there were fines   24   of combined, I guess, $44 million paid by Cardinal    Golkow Litigation Services    Page: 78 (306 - 309)     Case:^^-�3g^g^te�>$ #� lSS^cE''^ ^2^8r8Q:8r#l-dl^^M:t^6g84    iew    Page 310      Page 312    1 for its breaches of the Controlled Substances Act,   l   actually adopting that as a policy, procedure, or    2 correct?   2   in any other form or format, correct?    3       A.

PagelD #: 127937    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    I.         Introduction    A.        Qualifications    1.   I graduated from St. Johns University, College of Pharmacy, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Pharmacy in 1963.    2.   Upon graduating from St. John's University, College of Pharmacy, with a Bachelor of Science degree, I practiced as a licensed pharmacist from 1963 to 1966. I was a licensed pharmacist in the states of Virginia and New York. I later retired my pharmacist licenses as I was not practicing.    3.   In 1966,1 began working for the New York State Department of Health, Bureau of Narcotic Control, inspecting nursing homes, pharmacies, and hospitals, and investigating forged prescriptions.    4.   I entered federal service in 1969 with the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (""BNDD""), the predecessor agency to the Drug Enforcement Administration (""DEA""), where I was assigned from 1969 to 1973 as a Special Agent in the New York Regional Office. I conducted criminal and regulatory investigations of dosage form and bulk manufacturers, distributors, hospitals, researchers, analytical laboratories, importers, exporters and pharmacies.    5.   I attended the BNDD Training School in 1969. This consisted of a multi-month intensive training program which covered topics related to controlled substances including investigative techniques, undercover work, firearms training, and rules and regulations. While stationed in New York with the BNDD, I also attended the University of Rhode Island College of Pharmacy for one month to take a summer course on pharmaceutical manufacturing of controlled substances.    6.   In 1972,1 was promoted to Group Supervisor at DEA. As a Group Supervisor, I supervised both Special Agents and Diversion Investigators.    7.   In 1973, I was transferred to DEA headquarters in Washington DC where I was assigned to head the newly formed Diversion Prevention Program, staffed by a specialized work force of Diversion Investigators. At this time, I changed my position from a Special Agent to a Diversion Investigator. I was assigned to head and build out the Diversion Prevention Program. In this position I guided the implementation of domestic and worldwide programs associated with preventing the diversion of legally produced controlled substances and chemicals, formulated legislation and regulations to curtail potential diversion, evaluated controlled substances for scheduling under the CSA, and established security and recordkeeping systems and audit and investigative procedures. I also represented DEA in meetings and conferences with officials from international, federal, state and local agencies, the United Nations, the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, and the health care community.    8.    Starting in 1973,1 taught new-hire Diversion Investigators about the controlled substances regulations at DEA.     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 6 of 43.  PagelD #: 127938    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    9.   During my 22-year tenure with DEA, I held various management positions prior to my appointment as Deputy Director of DEA's Office of Diversion Control in 1982, where I served until retirement from federal service in 1990.    10. In 1991, I established Buzzeo Associates, LTD which specialized in providing guidance regarding the implementing regulations of the Controlled Substance Act. I later formed PDMA, Inc. to provide consulting relating to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 (PDMA) which was signed into law by the President on April 22, 1988 and was enacted (1) to ensure that drug products purchased by consumers are safe and effective, and (2) to avoid the unacceptable risk to American consumers from counterfeit, adulterated, misbranded, sub potent, or expired drugs. The legislation was necessary to increase safeguards in the drug distribution system to prevent the introduction and retail sale of substandard, ineffective, or counterfeit drugs.    11. Buzzeo Associates, LTD and PDMA, Inc. merged into BuzzeoPDMA, Inc. BuzzeoPDMA specialized in both PDMA and CSA regulatory issues.    12. In 2005, BuzzeoPDMA was acquired by Dendrite; in 2007 Dendrite was acquired by Cegedim; and in 2015 Cegedim was acquired by IMS Health.    13.1 retired on August 1, 2016 from IMS Health after 50 years working as a pharmacist, state investigator, Special Agent, Diversion Investigator, President of a regulatory and outsource company and Chief Regulatory Officer of the BuzzeoPDMA business unit.    14.1 am currently an Independent Consultant.    15.1 have had numerous TV, radio and press interviews and extensive public speaking before law enforcement agencies, major pharmaceutical companies, professional associations, civic groups, and school children and their parents. I have had articles published in a number of professional publications, such as the NARC Officer, Drug Topics, U.S. Pharmacist, American Druggist, ASIS Security Management, other professional bulletins and co-authored the ""Pharmacist's Controlled Substances Regulatory Guide and Compliance Manual"" and the ""CSA Compliance and Counseling Kit"" for pharmacists.    16.1 also served as President and Treasurer of the International Narcotic Enforcement Officers Association (ENEOA) whose membership consisted of representatives from the law enforcement community, industry, and medical professions and represented the United States at a number of international and UN sponsored forums. I was a member of the National Advisory Committee to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for Pain Management and State Regulatory Policy and also served as the Chairman of the American Society for Industrial Security (ASIS) Substance Abuse Committee for six years.    17. My CV is attached as Exhibit A    B.        Engagement for this Litigation    18. For my services as an expert witness, I am billing at a rate of $450.00 per hour plus reimbursement for expenses.  My compensation is not dependent on my testimony or on    -2-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 7 of 43.  PagelD #: 127939    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    the outcome of this case. All my opinions in this report are offered to a reasonable degree of professional certainty. I reserve the right to modify or supplement my opinions and this report should additional information become available.    II.        Assignment and Materials Considered    19.1 have been asked by counsel for Mallinckrodt LLC and SpecGx LLC (together ""Mallinckrodt"") to review the expert reports produced by the Track One Plaintiffs, in particular those related to the Controlled Substances Act, its implementing regulations, and the Defendants' suspicious order monitoring programs. In particular, I have focused on the reports of Seth Whitelaw, James Rafalski, Lacey Keller, and Craig McCann (together ""Plaintiffs' Experts""). I have reviewed these reports based on my years of industry experience focusing on the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations and have identified flaws in the assumptions, methodologies, and incomplete facts upon which these reports are based.    20.1 have also been asked by counsel for Mallinckrodt to review Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring program and anti-diversion program consistent with my years of industry experience auditing manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances and evaluate to a reasonable degree of certainty the effectiveness of Mallinckrodt's programs based on the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations; evolving DEA guidance; and evolving industry standards from 1998 to 2018 (the ""Review Period"").    21. In preparing this report, I reviewed the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations; DEA and industry guidance; Plaintiffs' Experts' reports; court filings; documents produced in this litigation; and certain depositions taken in this litigation. I have also relied on my more than fifty years of experience in the industry, including my 22 years working for DEA. A list of materials that I have considered is attached as Exhibit B    III.       Summary of Opinions    22. It is my opinion that during the Review Period Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances.    23. It is my opinion that during the Review Period Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA.    24. It is my opinion that throughout the Review Period DEA guidance and industry standards evolved over time and Mallinckrodt enhanced and upgraded its suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion programs to meet changing DEA guidance and industry standards.    25. It is my opinion that there is no statutory or regulatory obligation for manufacturers to monitor downstream registrants that are not their customers.    -3-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 8 of 43.  PagelD #: 127940    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    26. It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program.    27. It is my opinion that a suspicious order monitoring system that meets the regulations and expectations of DEA must be tailored to each individual registrant's business and the one-size-fits-all approach that Plaintiffs' counsel asked Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller to apply in their expert reports in this case is incorrect and does not identify suspicious orders placed to each of the Defendants.    IV.       Methodology    28. During my fifty years of experience in the industry, I have conducted dozens of audits of compliance systems, anti-diversion efforts, and suspicious order monitoring programs for DEA registrants. I have audited and evaluated suspicious order monitoring programs and anti-diversion programs of a number of controlled substances pharmaceutical manufacturers. I have assisted numerous registrants including controlled substances manufacturers in implementing suspicious order monitoring programs and anti-diversion programs.    29. In preparing this report, I evaluated Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring program and anti-diversion efforts in the same way as I have in the dozens of audits and evaluations of controlled substances registrants in my fifty years of experience. Consistent with industry standards and past practices, I reviewed: standard operating procedures; transcripts of testimony of those individuals most intimately involved in the controlled substances program, the suspicious order monitoring system and anti-diversion efforts; internal communications and documentation of Mallinckrodt's processes and procedures, Mallinckrodt's communications with federal entities including DEA; the Controlled Substances Act and implementing regulations; DEA guidance; and testimony relating to DEA's interpretation and expectations regarding the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations.    V.        Regulatory Scheme and DEA Oversight A.        Supply Chain Overview    30. Under the Controlled Substances Act (""CSA""), DEA is responsible for control and oversight of the ""closed system of distribution"" of controlled substances. In the 'closed system of distribution,' all handlers of controlled substances must be registered with DEA.    31. Every person or entity that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports, or exports any controlled substance or who proposes to engage in the manufacture, distribution, dispensing, importation or exportation of any controlled substance must obtain a registration unless exempted.1 The key registrants in the controlled substances supply chain are importers, manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and physicians.    ^lC.F.R. � 1301.11(a).    -4-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 9 of 43.  PagelD #: 127941    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    32. An importer must possess a registration and permit to import into the custom territory of the United States from any place outside of the United States a Schedule I or II controlled substance or any narcotic controlled substance listed in Schedule III, IV, or V.2 The importer may distribute the controlled substance, for which the registration was issued, to another registrant.3    33. A manufacturer may distribute the controlled substance for which DEA has issued the registration and may conduct chemical analysis and preclinical research (including quality control analysis) with controlled substances listed in those schedules for which authorization as a manufacturer was issued by DEA.4 A manufacturer with a DEA registration may distribute any of the controlled substances it manufactures to any entity which possesses the required registration, including, a distributor, chain pharmacy distribution center, wholesaler, or hospital.5 Generally, manufacturers have little to no interaction with dispensers like hospitals and independent pharmacies that dispense a controlled substance, as they sell their product to distributors and wholesalers who then distribute the product to their own registrant customers.    34. A distributor purchases controlled substances from manufacturers and then sells the product to DEA registered dispensers like hospitals and independent pharmacies.6 Distributors may also sell to other registered distributors.7    35. A pharmacy, pursuant to its registration, may dispense a controlled substance pursuant to a prescription for a legitimate medical requirement; return controlled substances; and dispose of controlled substances.8    36.  To prescribe controlled substances, a physician must obtain a registration that lists the schedules for the controlled substances the physician intends to dispense or prescribe.9 In addition, a physician must ensure that the prescription is for a legitimate medical requirement.10 In my experience, when a physician prescribes a controlled substance, the physician will write either the brand name or the generic of the drug prescribed and if the branded product has a generic version, the dispensing pharmacist typically will substitute the generic product for the brand unless the physician has written that the dispenser is to prescribe as written. If a generic is dispensed, the pharmacist dispenses the generic product that the pharmacy happens to have on hand at that time, regardless of the manufacturer.    221C.F.R. � 1312.11(a).    3 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(viii)    421C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(i).    5 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(ii).    6 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(ii).    7 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e).    8 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(e)(l)(iv).    9 21 C.F.R. � 1306.03(a)(2).    10 21 C.F.R. � 1306.04(a).    -5-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 10 of 43.  PagelD #: 127942    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    37. Each level of the supply chain has different requirements for records, security, accountability, labeling, and anti-diversion efforts as outlined in the CSA and implementing regulations.    B.        DEA Oversight: Registration    38. DEA decides who may handle controlled substances. An entity must register with DEA before it may lawfully purchase, sell, and handle controlled substances.11 No person who is not registered may engage in any activity with controlled substances.12 When an entity's registration application is approved, DEA issues a Certificate of Registration.13 Certificates of Registration are not indefinite; they have an expiration date and registrants must renew their registration in order to continue handling controlled substances.14 Manufacturers must renew their registration annually.15    39.  There are several types of DEA registrations, depending on the entities' primary activities with respect to controlled substances. These registrations include: manufacturer, distributor, reverse distributor, researcher, analytical lab, importer, exporter, pharmacy, hospitals, physicians, and narcotic treatment program.16    40. In order to issue a new registration, DEA must determine that such registration is consistent with the public interest in accordance with the CSA.17 For manufacturers and distributors, DEA must determine on a yearly basis that the registration remains in the public interest.18    41. A registrant who engages in more than one activity must obtain a separate registration for each activity.19 A DEA registrant is also authorized to engage in certain coincident activities without obtaining a registration to engage in such coincident activities, unless specifically exempted, if he/she complies with all requirements and duties prescribed by law for those registered to engage in such coincident activities.20    42. In the case of an application for registration or reregi strati on to manufacture in bulk a basic class of controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II, DEA will, upon the filing of an application, publish in the Federal Register a notice naming the applicant and stating that the applicant has applied to be registered as a bulk manufacturer of a basic class of narcotic or nonnarcotic controlled substance.21 These requirements for publication do not apply to    11 21 C.F.R. � 1301.11(a).    12 21 C.F.R. � 1301.13(a).

DEA has the authority to audit registrants to ensure compliance with the CSA.23 DEA has many tools at its disposal to take action against any registrant that may not be in compliance with the CSA or implementing regulations, including letters of admonition, licensing hearings, orders to show cause, and immediate suspension orders.24 DEA can also seek civil or criminal penalties for violations of the CSA.25    C.        DEA Oversight: Quota    44. DEA decides how much of each Schedule I and II controlled substance each registrant can manufacture and/or sell. There are three types of quotas established annually by DEA to regulate the manufacture and distribution of Schedules I and II controlled substances.26    45.  The quota system was instituted under the Narcotic Manufacturing Act of 1960 in order for the United States to be in compliance with the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.27 The purpose of quotas was to limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the manufacture of narcotic drugs.28 With the passage of the CSA in 1970, the system was revised to establish quotas on a calendar year basis for all Schedule I and II controlled substances.29 Quota is one of the tools used by DEA (along with registration, records, security provisions, reporting requirements, scheduling, and import and export controls) to establish a closed system for the legitimate distribution chain.    46. Aggregate production quota places a national limit on the amount of each controlled substance in Schedules I and II which may be produced in a given year.30 DEA, with the advice of the Food and Drug Administration, establishes production quotas for each basic class of controlled substances in Schedules I and II to be manufactured each calendar year to provide for the estimated medical, scientific, research and industrial needs of the United States, for lawful export requirements, and for the establishment and maintenance of reserve stocks.31    47. Manufacturing quota is the amount of a controlled substance a company can produce in a given calendar year.32 DEA issues individual manufacturing quotas to registered bulk manufacturers.33 Manufacturing quotas are determined on the basis of each manufacturer's    22 21 C.F.R. � 1301.33(c).    23 21 C.F.R. � 1301.31.    24 21 C.F.R. � 1301.36(a)-(e).    25 21 U.S.C. � 843(d); 21 C.F.R. � 1316.31.    26 21 U.S.C. � 826(a)(1).    27 Pub.

Procurement quota is issued to registered manufacturers who purchase the bulk controlled substance and formulate the substance into finished dosage forms.37 Procurement quotas are issued annually by the ""share-of-the-market theory"" to the various procurement quota applicants.38 Share-of-the market is determined by calculating the percentage of business a firm did in a particular basic class the previous year as compared to the total sales of all the firms utilizing that same basic class.39    49. DEA is required to set the aggregate production quota consistent with the estimated medical, scientific, research, and industrial needs of the United States.40 In determining the amount of aggregate production needed by the United States, DEA considers such factors as: estimates from IMS Health on retail consumption based on prescriptions dispensed; data from DEA's internal ARCOS tracking system; past histories of quota granted; estimates of the projected medical, scientific, and reserve stock needs provided by FDA's controlled substances staff; manufacturers' production history and anticipated needs; data on diversion of controlled substances, such as information from case seizures and national databases of drug evidence; and any other information that DEA deems relevant.41 As Stacy Harper-Avilla, DEA's designated witness on this topic made clear, each of these factors was considered during the Review Period.42 Based on these considerations, DEA sets the total amount of material for each controlled substance that may be manufactured in a given year.43 This amount is adjusted by inventory requirements of the bulk manufacturers and apportioned among them, through manufacturing quotas based upon their respective historical share of the market.44 The sum of these manufacturing quotas does not and cannot exceed the aggregate production quota.45    50. A manufacturer may not manufacture and distribute beyond the manufacturing or procurement quota provided to it by DEA in a calendar year.46 If market conditions change    21 C.F.R. � 1303.22.    34  -    35 21 C.F.R. � 1303.22.    36 21 C.F.R. � 1303.26.    37 21 C.F.R. � 1303.12(b).    38 21 C.F.R. � 1303.12(c).    39 21 C.F.R. � 1303.11.    40 21 C.F.R. � 1303.11(a).    41US-DEA-00015423 at 9-10.    42 Harper-AvillaDep.

D.        DEA Oversight: ARCOS    51. DEA can see the details of every transaction of Schedule I and II controlled substances as well as narcotic controlled substances in Schedule III in DEA's Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) database.47 To feed the ARCOS database, DEA requires registrants to report transactions of those controlled substances.48    52. Acquisition/distribution transaction reports must be filed by registrants at least every quarter, or more frequently depending on the number of transactions reported by the registrant.49 In addition to reporting acquisition/distribution transactions, each registrant who is registered to manufacture controlled substances in bulk or dosage form must report manufacturing transactions on controlled substances in Schedules I and II, and each narcotic controlled substance listed in Schedule III.50    53. All ARCOS reports must be filed with DEA.51 The registrant must provide the data in a manner as to identify the particular form, strength, and trade name, if any, of the product containing the controlled substance for which the report is being made.52 Registrants filing reports must utilize the National Drug Code Number assigned to the product under the National Drug Code System of the Food and Drug Administration.53    54.  Thus, all transactions of the Schedule II opioids at issue in this matter are reported to DEA and reflected in the ARCOS database. Through the reporting by manufacturers and distributors of Schedule II opioid products, among other products, DEA has full visibility of opioids through the distribution chain to the pharmacy level on a nationwide basis. This allows DEA to determine orders and purchases that may warrant DEA review.    VI.      Anti-Diversion Regulations    55.  The supply chain for controlled substances is regulated by DEA based on the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations.54 The anti-diversion language of the CSA has not changed since 1971, nor has the suspicious order monitoring regulation.55    47 Wright Dep.

The CSA requires that manufacturers must maintain ""effective controls against diversion of particular controlled substances into other than legitimate medical, scientific, and industrial channels"" in order to obtain and keep a license to manufacturer controlled substances.56 It further requires that:    All applicants and registrants shall provide effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances. In order to determine whether a registrant has provided effective controls against diversion, the Administrator shall use the security requirements set forth in Sees. 1301.72-1301.76 as standards for the physical security controls and operating procedures necessary to prevent diversion.57    In evaluating the overall security system of a registrant or applicant, the Administrator may consider any of the following factors as he may deem relevant to the need for strict compliance with security requirements: (1) The type of activity conducted (e.g., processing of bulk chemicals, preparing dosage forms, packaging, labeling, cooperative buying, etc.); (2) The type and form of controlled substances handled (e.g., bulk liquids or dosage units, usable powders or non-usable powders); (3) The quantity of controlled substances handled; (4) The location of the premises and the relationship such location bears on security needs; (5) The type of building construction comprising the facility and the general characteristics of the building or buildings; (6) The type of vault, safe, and secure enclosures or other storage system (e.g., automatic storage and retrieval system) used; (7) The type of closures on vaults, safes, and secure enclosures; (8) The adequacy of key control systems and/or combination lock control systems; (9) The adequacy of electric detection and alarm systems, if any including use of supervised transmittal lines and standby power sources; (10) The extent of unsupervised public access to the facility, including the presence and characteristics of perimeter fencing, if any; (11) The adequacy of supervision over employees having access to manufacturing and storage areas; (12) The procedures for handling business guests, visitors, maintenance personnel, and nonemployee service personnel; (13) The availability of local police protection or of the registrant's or applicant's security personnel; (14) The adequacy of the registrant's or applicant's system for monitoring the receipt, manufacture, distribution, and disposition of controlled substances in its operations; and (15) The applicability of the security requirements contained in all Federal, State, and local laws and regulations governing the management of waste.58    57. Based on my experience with DEA, I understand that the CSA requires registrants to maintain effective controls against diversion while the product is under their control. Each registrant is responsible for the product until it is received by another registrant. This focus    21 U.S.C. � 823(a)(1). 21 C.F.R. � 1301.71(a). 21 C.F.R. � 1301.71(b).    -10-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 15 of 43.  PagelD #: 127947    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    of the statutory language is made clear by the security requirements laid out in 21 CFR 1301.71-1301.93. The expectation of the CSA is not that the registrant polices the entire supply chain, but rather that the registrant maintains effective controls against diversion and adequate security measures while it has control over the product.59    58.  The CSA does not define what ""effective controls"" means, does not contain examples of what constitutes ""effective controls"" and does not provide any further guidance about what manufacturers are required to do, but it is clear on its face that the focus is on preventing diversion while product remains in the registrant's control.    59. 21 CFR 1301.74(b) is no different. It focuses on what a registrant must do in relation to its orders from its own customers while the product is still under the registrant's control.    B.        Regulatory Duty: 21 C.F.R. Section 1301.74(b)    60. 21 CFR 1301.74(b) states: ""The registrant shall design and operate a system to disclose to the registrant suspicious orders of controlled substances. The registrant shall inform the Field Division Office of the Administration in his area of suspicious orders when discovered by the registrant. Suspicious orders include orders of unusual size, orders deviating substantially from a normal pattern, and orders of unusual frequency.""60    61. Neither the CSA nor any of the implementing regulations defines the term ""unusual size."" Neither the CSA nor any of the implementing regulations defines the term ""normal pattern."" Neither the CSA nor any of the implementing regulations defines the term ""unusual frequency."" I understand that several current and former DEA officials have testified in this case, and all agree that DEA has not defined any of these terms.61    62. Instead, DEA left it up to registrants to determine what those terms meant and to create and design their own suspicious order monitoring program accordingly. Based on my experience in DEA and in industry, I understand that DEA did not define these terms in part because it believed there was no one-size-fits-all approach to suspicious order monitoring.62 In fact, DEA 30(b)(6) witness Thomas Prevoznik admitted that there is ""no single feature that makes a suspicious order monitoring system compliant"" and agreed that    59 Rannazzisi Dep.

I said I don't expect you to police the supply chain, but I do expect you to police your own customers."").    60 21 C.F.R. � 1301.74(b). The regulation is clear on its face that registrants are only required to report orders that are actually suspicious.    61 See Prevoznik Dep. Tr. Vol. 1 at 273:7-20 (""With respect to orders that are placed to manufacturers, what constitutes an order of unusual size in the DEA's view? A.

For a time, DEA engaged in communications with manufacturers and distributors to discuss the suspicious order monitoring regulation and other DEA requirements. However, in my experience, DEA headquarters ceased most communications following the Rannazzisi DEA Letters of 2006 and 2007 and instead ramped up enforcement efforts.    64.  The suspicious order monitoring regulation has not changed since it was implemented.64 It is my understanding that in recent years DEA has been working on a change to the suspicious order monitoring regulation, which may further define the term ""suspicious order,"" but there has been no notice and comment and no new regulation.65    C.        There is no statutory or regulatory obligation for manufacturers to know their customers' customers    65. In my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, I have never seen or heard DEA state that there is a statutory obligation in the CSA or a regulatory obligation in the suspicious order monitoring regulation for manufacturers to know their customers' customers. Demetra Ashley of DEA testified that she was not aware of any statute or regulation that requires a manufacturer to know its customers' customers.66    66. In my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, I have never seen a DEA guidance letter or other DEA public statement or suggestion reflecting an obligation for a manufacturer to know its customers' customers.67 Based on my review of the testimony in this case, current and former DEA personnel have stated that there is no obligation for a manufacturer to monitor the activities of downstream registrants beyond its own customers. In his deposition, Joe Rannazzisi testified that he was not familiar with the phrase ""know    63    Id.    64 Rannazzisi Dep. Tr. Vol. 1 at 253:10-23; Prevoznik's Dep. Tr.

As discussed in detail below, this was not an industry expectation at the time; as an industry consultant we did not consider it to be industry standard or required by the regulation. Similarly, Mallinckrodt heard a one-off comment about ""know your customers' customers"" during an audit in 2010, but this did not reflect the position of DEA at the time and was contradicted by others in DEA contemporaneously.    -12-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 17 of 43.

Instead, the expectation and industry standard, consistent with the plain language of the CSA and the suspicious order monitoring regulation, was for manufacturers to monitor the orders they received from their customers (distributors, wholesalers, and distribution centers of retail pharmacy chains) and have a system in place to report suspicious orders that they received from their customers.    67. Further, the suspicious order monitoring regulation refers to ""orders.""70 Mallinckrodt receives orders from its customers, which are distributors, wholesalers, and distribution centers of retail pharmacy chains. An order is a transaction between a manufacturer and its customer and DEA has never indicated that ""order"" refers to anything other than a transaction between the registrant and their direct customer. Every registrant has a responsibility to monitor the orders received from the customer next to it in the supply chain.71 There is no regulatory requirement or expectation that manufacturers police the entire supply chain down to pharmacies, physicians, or patients.72    D. There is no statutory or regulatory obligation to collect, maintain, or utilize downstream transactional data, including chargeback data, for purposes of suspicious order monitoring    68.  Consistent with the plain language of the CSA and its implementing regulations, and in my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, I have never seen or heard DEA state that there is a statutory or regulatory obligation for a registrant to collect, maintain, or utilize downstream transactional data, including chargeback data, for purposes of anti-diversion monitoring.

By way of example, when Mr. Wright was asked in his deposition what role chargebacks play in suspicious order monitoring, he responded ""none.""74 Similarly, DEA's 30(b)(6) witness Mr. Prevoznik testified that DEA has never issued guidance to manufacturers informing them that they should review chargeback data.75    70. In my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, it is not industry standard for manufacturers to collect, maintain, or utilize downstream transactional data, including chargeback data, for suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion purposes.    71. While I was aware of chargeback data during my time as an industry consultant, it was only discussed in the context of financial arrangements between registrants. Chargebacks are a financial reconciliation method between manufacturers and their customers that take place in connection with some but not all of the customers' downstream sales.76    72. In more recent years, since approximately 2012, although not required by the CSA or its implementing regulations, some registrants have explored the question of how they might use alternative data sources, like downstream transactional data, to address specific instances of potential downstream diversion that they become aware of. However, based on my experience, chargebacks were never used, discussed or thought of in the industry as something to be used for suspicious order monitoring. Because chargeback data is backward looking and does not reflect ""orders"" placed with the manufacturer registrant, this financial data was not considered a resource or tool for the purpose of suspicious order monitoring. As discussed throughout this report, in my years of industry experience I have never been aware of any obligation requiring manufacturers to monitor chargebacks and report them as if they were orders through their suspicious order monitoring programs.    73. In addition, I am aware that prescription data is used by manufacturers for commercial purposes and by DEA for making quota determinations of controlled substances.77 Prescription data is not order data and provides limited information about a manufacturers' product. In my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, it was not industry    73 In fact, the first time I ever heard a claim of a requirement that manufacturers must utilize downstream transactional data was in reading Plaintiffs' expert reports in this case.

VII.     Mallinckrodt's Anti-Diversion Program Was Consistent with Anti-Diversion Regulations, Guidance, and Industry Standards During the Review Period    74. Mallinckrodt was founded in 1867 in St. Louis, Missouri to supply local pharmacists with materials and chemicals. When founded, Mallinckrodt was the only chemical supply company west of Philadelphia.78 Mallinckrodt began producing morphine and codeine in 1898. In the twentieth century, Mallinckrodt continued to advance the production of chemicals and pharmaceutical ingredients, improving the stability and safety of numerous medications. Mallinckrodt has manufactured controlled substances, in particular active pharmaceutical ingredients, since before DEA was formed in 1971.79 In that time, Mallinckrodt has worked in partnership with DEA to ensure that the legitimate needs of patients were met while taking steps to address the potential diversion of its products. In 2000, Mallinckrodt was acquired by Tyco International's healthcare division, which became Covidien in 2007. Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals later split from Covidien in 2013 to become an independent public company focusing on specialty pharmaceutical products and diagnostic imaging agents.80    75. While the CSA and suspicious order monitoring regulation have not changed since the 1970s, and DEA guidance has been limited, industry standards and compliance practices have evolved overtime. In my experience as an industry consultant, much of this evolution is related to advancements in technology. The tools, technology, and information available in 1995, or even in 2005, are very different from tools, technology, and information available today. In my opinion, based on my experience in DEA and as an industry consultant, Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program was consistent with the Controlled Substances Act, DEA regulations, and industry standards at all times during the Review Period, 1998 through 2018. In addition, Mallinckrodt's chargeback review and monitoring system developed in 2010 and 2011 goes above and beyond both regulatory requirements and industry standards.    A.        1998-2007: Excessive Purchase Reporting    1.         1998-2007 Regulatory Landscape    76. Based on my extensive experience in DEA and in industry, from the passage of the CSA in 1971 to late 2006, DEA worked with the industry to make sure that registrants were implementing and following registration, records, quota, ARCOS, and security requirements in the CSA. DEA's priority during this time was to investigate in-transit losses and thefts and to investigate pharmacy registrants. Prior to 2006, it is my experience that DEA  focused  on  and  devoted  resources  to  practitioner  and  pharmacy-level    78 Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, Our Story, http://www.mallinckrodt.com/about/our-story/.    79 Id. mId.    -15-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 20 of 43.

During this time, DEA expectation was that a manufacturer would report to DEA excessive purchases by its customers. As Mr. Wright confirmed in his deposition testimony, the excessive purchase reporting system was the accepted practice by DEA for many years prior to 2008.81    2.         1998-2007 DEA Guidance    78. During this time, the only limited guidance for manufacturers regarding suspicious order monitoring was in an appendix to DEA's Chemical Handler's Manual, which recommended a voluntary computer algorithm to analyze orders submitted to a registrant to flag purchases that exceeded the algorithm.82    79. DEA did not provide any guidance other than the Chemical Handlers Manual until it began a distributor briefing initiative concerning internet pharmacies in 2005. As Mr. Prevoznik testified, DEA had determined by 2005 that with the rise of the internet, diversion was becoming more of a national issue.83 Therefore, DEA decided to sit down with distributors and provide them data about internet pharmacies. There was no such manufacturer initiative.84    80. In 2006, Joe Rannazzisi at DEA sent a letter to every commercial entity in the United States registered with DEA to distribute controlled substances with guidance on how to monitor    81    Wright Dep.

PagelD #: 127953    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    orders received from pharmacies.85 The letter focused on distributors' obligations with respect to their sales to pharmacy customers.86 It outlined ""red flags"" that distributors should look for when monitoring orders from pharmacies.87 This letter made no mention of obligations specific to a manufacturer and did not reference red flags that manufacturers should look for when monitoring orders received from distributors.    3.          1998-2007 Industry Standards    81. As a consultant during this time, 1998-2007,1 understood industry practice to be periodic reporting of excessive purchases to DEA. It is my experience in the industry that, 1998-2007, DEA headquarters and field offices expected and accepted from manufacturers excessive purchase reports, and approved excessive purchase report programs.88 Excessive purchase reports were documentation of orders that hit on a particular algorithm that were then provided to DEA on a monthly or quarterly basis based on instructions of the local DEA office that had authority over the registrant. While all purchases on the excessive purchase reports were not necessarily indicative of diversion, Mallinckrodt reported all excessive purchases and DEA accepted these reports.    82.  The goal of reporting excessive purchases was to provide DEA with information that the agency could use to determine whether to investigate certain registrants. The industry standard at the time was to provide this information to DEA and then it was DEA, not the manufacturer, who was responsible for undertaking any investigation of purchases reflected on excessive purchase reports. In my experience, the only other DEA expectation for manufacturers at this time was that they verify that each customer had a current DEA registration and that therefore DEA had determined that the customer had met the security requirements of the CSA.    83. During this time, 1998-2007, DEA also never suggested that manufacturers had any responsibilities with respect to knowing downstream registrants. DEA regulations do not require that a manufacturer review a pharmacy's registration before selling to a distributor and do not require that manufacturers examine individual patient prescriptions; there was no suggestion during this time that manufacturers should do so.    4.          1998-2007 Mallinckrodt Program    84. From 1998-2007, Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program had several components that were consistent with DEA expectations and industry practice at the time. First, Mallinckrodt had an algorithm in place based on the algorithm guidance in the Chemical Handler's Manual that monitored and flagged orders.89 The algorithm measured each customer against its    85US-DEA-00001767    86 Id.    %1Id.    88    Wright Dep.

In addition to the algorithm that generated excessive purchase reports, Mallinckrodt took additional steps to monitor incoming orders. For example, Mallinckrodt's customer service representatives reviewed orders as they were received.92 Customer service representatives were familiar with customer and order patterns and would escalate anything that appeared to be of unusual size, frequency or pattern to the customer service manager and then to the Controlled Substances Compliance group.93 The customer service representatives were trained on what to look for in incoming orders and how to clear Form 222s.94 In addition, National Account Managers (NAMs) would meet with customers on a regular basis. NAMs were the ""eyes and ears"" of the suspicious order monitoring program and looked for red flags indicative of diversion.95 NAMs were trained by the Controlled Substances group to bring any questions or concerns to the compliance department's attention.

Mallinckrodt also reviewed all new customers to check that they had a valid license.97 As discussed above, DEA was required to determine that each registration was in the public interest and determine on a yearly basis that the registration remained in the public interest.98 Mallinckrodt also pulled Dun and Bradstreet credit reports as part of their diligence on new customers.99    87. Based on my review of documents and testimony in this case, I have been unable to locate explicit standard operating procedures regarding the anti-diversion and suspicious order monitoring systems that were in place at Mallinckrodt during the 1998-2007 time period. However, given the consistency of the deposition testimony of the key individuals involved with Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program during this time, and my experience with typical document retention policies, I believe that the suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion practices discussed above were followed by Mallinckrodt 1998-2007.10�    88. It is my opinion that 1998-2007, Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances.    89. It is my opinion that 1998-2007, Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA.101    90. It is my opinion that 1998-2007 Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program.    96    Harper Dep.

Vol. 1 at 358:21-59:1.    101  To the extent Mr. Rafalski criticizes Mallinckrodt for the number of suspicious orders reported, this shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the industry and the suspicious order monitoring regulation. Rafalski Rep. at 166. In my experience, registrants may have perfect suspicious order monitoring programs that do not report any orders because none of the orders is suspicious. In fact, it is not surprising that Mallinckrodt reported a relatively small number of suspicious orders given its customer base.    -19-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 24 of 43.

Although DEA wrote letters to the industry in 2006 and 2007, there was no change to the CSA's anti-diversion requirements or suspicious order monitoring regulation.102 Accordingly, consistent with prior years, neither the CSA nor the suspicious order monitoring regulation suggested that manufacturers needed to take any action to police the supply chain beyond the orders from their customers.    2.         2008-2009 DEA Guidance    92. In late 2007, all registrants received a letter from Joe Rannazzisi at DEA that reflected a significant change in DEA's guidance with respect to suspicious order monitoring.103 The 2007 DEA Letter explicitly stated that a registrant could no longer rely on past DEA statements regarding its suspicious order monitoring program.104 DEA stated that it would no longer accept excessive purchase reports that it had expected and accepted previously. The 2007 DEA Letter undermined everything the industry had understood at all times prior to 2008. DEA stated explicitly that it would refuse to provide guidance on suspicious order monitoring programs going forward.    93. First, the 2007 DEA Letter suggested that the previously-recommended algorithm from the Chemical Handlers Manual and industry was insufficient. The Agency warned that ""DEA does not approve or otherwise endorse any specific system for reporting suspicious orders. Past communications . . . that could be construed as approval of a particular system for reporting suspicious orders, should no longer be taken to mean that DEA approves a specific system.""105 In my experience, this was a significant change for the industry, required the industry to change how it implemented the suspicious order monitoring regulation, and was not based on any change to the CSA or suspicious order monitoring regulation but a new interpretation and attempts at enforcement of the same unchanged regulation.    94.  Second, the 2007 DEA Letter articulated brand new guidance from DEA that: ""[rjegistrants must conduct an independent analysis of suspicious orders prior to completing a sale.""106 Prior to this time, the Agency, through both headquarters and its field offices, had consistently accepted and signed off on programs in which registrants reported excessive    102 Rannazzisi Dep.

DEA has acknowledged that the 2007 DEA Letter was a major change for industry. Kyle Wright of DEA's Office of Diversion Control confirmed in sworn testimony in a 2011 Eastern District of Michigan case that the new investigate and halt-shipment requirements were a ""significant change"" to registrants' obligations.108 Mr. Wright also testified that, until the change in policy, ""DEA was aware that it was standard practice in the industry to file suspicious order reports while continuing to ship products, and that practice had been approved by the DEA.""1091 understand that Mr. Wright confirmed this belief in his more recent testimony in this case.110 Based on my experience in the industry, I agree with Mr. Wright's testimony that the 2007 DEA Letter signified a major change for the industry with little guidance on how to implement this major change in policy. Based on my experience, it is my opinion that DEA shifted responsibility for identifying potential investigative targets from the agency to industry without providing sufficient guidance to industry.111    96.   The 2007 DEA Letter does not mention the concept of knowing your customers' customers and does not suggest collecting or utilizing downstream transactional data for suspicious order monitoring.112 Based on my experience with DEA and industry consulting, there is nothing I reviewed in the letter that suggests that a manufacturer has an obligation to know their customers' customers or suggests that a manufacturer must collect or utilize downstream transactional data for suspicious order monitoring.    3.        2008-2009 Industry Standards    97.   During this time, manufacturers worked to implement the brand new DEA guidance in the 2007 DEA Letter. After sending the letter, DEA did not provide any further guidance to manufacturers.113 My understanding is that members of the industry, including Mallinckrodt, requested additional guidance and DEA did not respond.114 DEA also    107  Bench Trial Transcript at 382:24-383:18, United States v.

The 2007 DEA Letter did not provide guidance to manufacturers on what the order investigation process should look like. While the letter stated that registrants should investigate before shipping, there was no guidance about the point in time at which registrants must report. It was unclear whether registrants should report before the investigation {i.e., report potentially suspicious orders that were subsequently investigated by the registrant and, if cleared, were shipped) or report after the investigation {i.e., report only those orders that were confirmed suspicious after investigation and were not shipped).116 The 2007 DEA Letter also contained no detail about how to conduct due diligence on orders and the industry had no guidance about what type of diligence DEA expected.117    99.   Based on my experience, during the 2008-2009 time frame there was no discussion in industry that manufacturers must know their customers' customers because DEA had never mentioned an obligation or suggested that manufacturers know their customers' customers. Similarly, it was not industry practice for manufacturers to collect, maintain, or utilize any downstream transactional data for anti-diversion purposes because DEA had never mentioned the possibility of using downstream transactional data for these purposes. In my experience, the industry correctly viewed downstream transactional data as after-the-fact-data used for financial reconciliation.    4.        2008-2009 Mallinckrodt Program    100. After receipt of the December 2007 DEA Letter announcing the significant change in policy, Mallinckrodt took immediate steps to enhance its program consistent with DEA's changing guidance.118 Mallinckrodt promptly created a multidisciplinary Suspicious Order Monitoring Team (""SOM Team"") to work to update its suspicious order monitoring program.119 Mallinckrodt's SOM Team was led by members of the security, compliance, and legal departments, and also included customer service, operations, logistics, and    ma'am.. ..

In early 2008, Mallinckrodt received and complied with a request from the DEA St. Louis Field Office that it should stop sending excessive purchase reports.122 During the months when Mallinckrodt had ceased sending excessive purchase reports and was working to refine the suspicious order monitoring program and algorithm, Mallinckrodt maintained its prior suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion efforts, including (1) monitoring incoming orders; (2) understanding existing customers; (3) reviewing new customers; and (4) flagging orders as potentially suspicious and reporting to DEA.123    102. Starting in 2008 and continuing into 2009, Mallinckrodt engaged in a multi-year effort to enhance and improve its suspicious order monitoring program. This effort is consistent with what I would expect from an organization trying to act on new and different agency guidance in a responsible way. In order to better understand the brand new guidance in the 2007 DEA Letter, Mallinckrodt reached out to industry consultants the Drug and Chemical Advisory Group and studied industry guidelines developed by HDMA.124 Both Mr. Rafalski and Dr. Whitelaw criticize Mallinckrodt for continuously updating its suspicious order monitoring standard operating procedures during this time period.125 This criticism is unfounded, as I would expect a company to revise and enhance its SOPs as it evolves its program based on changing regulatory guidance. Based on my experience in the industry, this is what I would expect to see from a company trying to enhance a compliance program based on limited regulatory guidance.    103. To enhance its program consistent with the new DEA guidance, Mallinckrodt first revised its suspicious order monitoring algorithm to generate a daily Peculiar Order Report of flagged orders that raised a question as to their size, frequency, or pattern.126 Mallinckrodt    120 Harper Dep.

PagelD #: 127960    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    reviewed and investigated the orders and determined whether they should be shipped or not shipped and reported to DEA.127    104. The customer service managers took a multi-step approach when conducting diligence on orders flagged on the Peculiar Order Reports. 128 First, they solicited information from Customer Service Representatives. They then reached out to Product Managers for more information about the particular product at issue in the order and the market for that product (for example, a product manager would be able to inform the customer service manager that a product was backordered). They also reached out to National Account Managers for additional information and to request further information from the customer. National Account Managers visited customers regularly and therefore had the best and most up-to-date information about any given customer and their ordering patterns.129 The customer service representatives then took all of the collected information and made a determination as to whether the order was suspicious and should be reported. Over time, Mallinckrodt enhanced the order investigation process and developed more formal due diligence policies. While NAMs were consulted regarding specific potentially suspicious orders, the controlled substances compliance group had the final say on whether or not to    the algorithm. There were a number of draft policies circulated and the algorithm multiplier changed from|    because theQ multiplier was unworkably over-inclusive. In my experience, this is not unusual.    127 Over time, the group responsible for monitoring shifted from customer service managers trained by the controlled    substances compliance group, to trade compliance and then to controlled substances compliance personnel. While it    was not improper for a customer service manager to perform the monitoring function, Mallinckrodt determined that it    would be better for monitoring to be conducted in compliance.    128RauschDep. Tr. at 71:10-72:12:    If an order was flagged as being peculiar, it was during my time, my job or responsibility to talk to    marketing or our customer service reps, who would be the first people that I would talk to because    they were in tuned to our customers and what their order needs were, and they would know if there    was anything unusual as far as a distributor picking up a new customer that they hadn't had before    that they would now need increased material to supply. And if our CSR did not have a ~ an answer    to why the customer was ordering more, I would go to the product manager, or business manager,    whatever they were being called at the time, who had that particular product that the order was for,    and I would ask them if they knew why all of a sudden we were having a peculiar order from that    customer. And a peculiar order, again, would be unusual quantity from what they have bought in    the past over a period of time based upon the log rhythms {sic} we set in place in our computer    system. If they didn't know, my next step would be going to the salesperson and asking them.    1291 have reviewed examples of such due diligence. I would note that due diligence is different for every order and    every customer, and it is not surprising to me that ordering patterns of wholesale and distributor customers changed    frequently. For example, a manufacturer exiting the market or a distributor obtaining a new customer could    significantly change customer order patterns.  MNK-T10007105639 (Carta Johnson in Logistics Planning emails    Kate Muhlenkamp and Vince Kaiman about increased orders as a result of Actavis supply issues, requesting insight    for the increases ""[bjecause this is a substantial increase, and we'll likely need to explain the cause."").    -24-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 29 of 43.

Second, to further enhance its program consistent with the new DEA guidance, Mallinckrodt revised its customer diligence processes in order to better ""know its customers."" This included new customer screening procedures and development of customer questionnaires132 and checklists for existing customers, as well as an automatic ""do not ship"" list for customers that Mallinckrodt determined that it should not sell to.133 It also included more training and involvement of the National Account Managers, who served as the ""boots on the ground"" gathering information about customers and reporting back to the Controlled Substances Compliance group.134 Based on my review of documents and procedures, Mallinckrodt's effort to know its customers crossed departments but decision-making power was retained by the Controlled Substances Compliance group with input from the legal department.135 Based on my experience, it is rational and appropriate for a company to include a broad group in such diligence efforts while, as here, decision-making power was retained by compliance and legal.    106. As Mallinckrodt continued to work to enhance its program based on the limited and changing DEA guidance, it also took affirmative steps when it received information suggesting the possibility of downstream diversion of its product. By way of example, on June 7, 2009, Mallinckrodt received an email from a Tennessee Police Officer alerting the Company   that   he   was   conducting   an   investigation   into   potential   diversion   of    130 Harper Dep.

And so if I knew of a circumstance that justified the reason for the additional order, or the peculiar order, then I'd discuss it with Karen and we would release the order. If not, we kind of kicked it up the chain and said, ""I can't figure out why they're ordering this,"" and then Karen would maybe get with marketing or whatever to resolve the problem."").    1311 understand that for a short time, peculiar orders may have been shipped before the investigation was complete although Mallinckrodt always completed the investigations. However, none of the shipped peculiar orders were found to be suspicious, and Mallinckrodt never shipped a suspicious order. MNK-T10000279153; Harper Dep. Tr. at 304:1-15.    132  Mr. Rafalski and Dr. Whitelaw criticize Mallinckrodt for removing a specific question regarding a customers' suspicious order monitoring program from the customer questionnaire in the course of the questionnaire development process.

PagelD #: 127962    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    pharmaceutical products and that he had discovered a bottle of Mallinckrodt product in the course of his investigation.136 The Tennessee Police Officer requested that Mallinckrodt assist him in attempting to determine the source of the product.137 Upon receipt of this request, Mallinckrodt immediately took action. Based on the lot number of the bottle, Mallinckrodt was able to research its shipping records and determine that only one distributor in Florida, Sunrise Wholesalers (""Sunrise"") had received product from that lot at that point in time.138 This, alone, of course, did not mean that product had been diverted from Sunrise, but Mallinckrodt took immediate steps to conduct due diligence on its customer.    107.   The very next day, Mallinckrodt placed a hold on the Sunrise account, cutting off all further shipments of Mallinckrodt product to Sunrise.139 Mallinckrodt's SOM Team then conducted an investigation into Sunrise, evaluating the information that Mallinckrodt had in its files while remaining in contact with the Tennessee Police Officer. Mallinckrodt's SOM Team learned that Sunrise employed a former DEA employee as a consultant who was responsible for ensuring that Sunrise sold to legitimate customers and took steps to ensure that Sunrise maintained effective controls against diversion. More importantly, Mallinckrodt learned that DEA had recently audited Sunrise and had offered no adverse findings.140 Based on this information, Mallinckrodt's SOM Team made the decision to resume shipments to Sunrise, but also decided that it would conduct an onsite audit of this customer.141    108.  Mallinckrodt's SOM Team promptly informed DEA of this information. Pete Kleissle, DEA St. Louis Diversion Investigator, informed Mallinckrodt that it ""had acted in a responsible way and he saw no issues with regard to this matter.""142 Mr. Kleissle was very complimentary of Mallinckrodt's commitment to an open dialogue with DEA and provision of information to law enforcement.143 With DEA's blessing, Mallinckrodt conducted an onsite audit of Sunrise in August of 2009. A team containing members of Mallinckrodt's compliance, sales, and data integrity groups reviewed Sunrise's building security, new customer screening process, suspicious order monitoring procedures, customer files, and DEA 222 forms. Mallinckrodt also spoke with Sunrise's onsite DEA consultant who was responsible for due diligence on Sunrise's customers.1441 have reviewed both the processes and conclusions of Mallinckrodt's on-site audit of Sunrise and it is consistent with how I conducted due diligence audits of registrants in my 50 years of industry experience.145 This proactive approach by Mallinckrodt demonstrates an    136 MNK-T10000562325.    137 Id.    138 Id.    139 MNK-T10000290242.    140 MNK-T10000562325.    141 Id.    142 Id.    143 Id.    144 MNK-T10000296090; MNK-T1_0000307243.    145  To the extent Plaintiffs' experts criticize Mallinckrodt's audit of Sunrise because it eventually surrendered its license to DEA, I find this hindsight criticism to be off base. My review indicates that Mallinckrodt conducted a thorough audit based on the information that was available to it. The fact that Sunrise surrendered its license nearly a    -26-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 31 of 43.  PagelD #: 127963    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    attempt to know its customers and engage in a partnership with law enforcement where evidence of diversion appears.    109. I understand that Mallinckrodt received positive feedback from DEA in 2009 and again in 2010, which illustrates that Mallinckrodt's program was in line with and exceeding DEA expectations and industry practice during this time. First, in a February 2009 meeting with Albany DEA, Diversion Investigator Heather White stated that she was ""content and impressed"" with Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring and reporting mechanism.146 The following year, a DEA St. Louis Diversion Program Manager stated that Mallinckrodt had the ""best suspicious order monitoring process he has seen to date"" and ""what he expected from Mallinckrodt as an industry leader.""147 In my experience at DEA and as an industry consultant, positive feedback from DEA is meaningful and Mallinckrodt could rely on DEA's commentary as an indication of a sufficient suspicious order monitoring program.    110. Based on my experience at DEA and as an industry consultant, Mallinckrodt took the steps I would expect from a responsible registrant based on new DEA guidance lacking in specific direction. As I would expect, Mallinckrodt put together a cross-functional team to enhance the program in line with DEA's new guidance. At the same time, Mallinckrodt took actions that evidence good corporate citizenship when it learned of any potential issues with respect to one of its customers. Based on my experience, Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program met the requirements of the regulation and statute, and went above and beyond industry standard for suspicious order monitoring during this time period.    11 Lit is my opinion that Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances in the 2008-2009 time period.148    112. It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA in the 2008-2009 time period.    113. It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program.    year later does not call into question the conclusions made by Mallinckrodt's team that were based on the facts available at the time.    146 MNK-T1_0000275446.    147 MNK-T1_0000421974.    1481 have reviewed the Victor Borelli email that is referenced in Dr. Whitelaw's report. MNK-T10000559532. Based on my experience and my review of Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring program, the email referring to opioids as Doritos was a callous and inappropriate email that was inconsistent with Mallinckrodt's role as a dedicated leader of suspicious order monitoring and DEA compliance. In my review of the documents, I have seen no evidence that anyone at the company was aware that this statement was made, and I have no doubt that if the company were aware of the statement that it would have taken appropriate action. I have also reviewed the email regarding Mr. Borelli from Cathy Stewart cited in Dr. Whitelaw's report, MNK-T10003028219, and after reviewing Ms. Stewart's testimony I understand that she was not concerned that Mr. Borelli was providing information that was inaccurate in an effort to make sales.

It is my opinion that DEA guidance and industry standards evolved in the 2008-2009 time period and Mallinckrodt enhanced and upgraded its suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion program to meet this changing DEA guidance and industry standards.    C.        2010-2011: Incorporation of Chargeback Data    1.         2010-2011 Regulatory Landscape    115. In the 2010-2011 time frame, there was no change to the CSA's anti-diversion requirements or suspicious order monitoring regulation.149 Accordingly, consistent with prior years, neither the CSA nor the suspicious order monitoring regulation suggested that manufacturers needed to take any action to police the supply chain beyond the orders from their customers.    2.         2010-2011 DEA Guidance    116. In the 2010-2011 time frame, DEA provided no further official guidance to industry. Manufacturers were still relying on the 2007 DEA Letter to understand DEA guidance. There was no DEA guidance requiring a registrant to know its customers' customers and no DEA guidance regarding an obligation or a suggestion that a registrant collect, maintain, and utilize downstream transactional data. Indeed, DEA witnesses have made clear that there was no such expectation and that they had not heard of such a requirement.150    117. The only time that Mallinckrodt heard the phrase ""know your customers' customers"" from DEA was in a one-off statement by a DEA Diversion Group Supervisor during a nonpublic audit where he told Mallinckrodt about a '""new direction' initiative whereby enforcement action will be aimed at all entities within the supply chain, including manufacturing registrants"" because ""[t]he expectation is becoming that suppliers have not only an obligation to know their customers but an additional responsibility to know their customers."" 151 The Diversion Group Supervisor provided no further information on what know your customers' customers means or looks like, and provided no detail on what it means to implement this developing expectation in an anti-diversion program.    118.1 am not aware of any other DEA field offices making a similar statement during this time period. In fact, I am aware of another DEA Diversion Investigator and Diversion Program    149 Rannazzisi Dep. Tr. Vol. 1 at 253:10-23; Prevoznik Dep. Tr.

PagelD #: 127965    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    Manager stating that there was no such requirement.152 Know your customers' customers was not something known to the industry prior to this point in time and the single mention by a DEA field office, later contradicted by another field office, does not appear to reflect a policy change. My understanding that there was no guidance from DEA that manufacturers should know their customers' customers is confirmed by DEA testimony in this case, which makes clear that there is no regulatory obligation, even to this day, for manufacturers to know their customers' customers.153    119. Based on my review of the documents and my expertise in the industry, there was no shift in DEA guidance in the 2010-2011 time period that would have created new obligations, including any obligation or expectation that manufacturers should monitor their customers' customers.    3.        2010-2011 Industry Standards    120. During this time, the industry standard was to monitor orders from your own direct customers. I am not aware of other manufacturers during this time period that monitored the downstream registrants that purchased the manufacturer's product from distributors. It was not standard industry practice for manufacturers to collect, maintain, or utilize any downstream transactional data for anti-diversion purposes because DEA had never mentioned the possibility of using downstream transactional data for these purposes.    121. Chargeback data is financial reconciliation data; it does not show ""orders"" placed to a manufacturer. Chargebacks are credits provided to distributors on certain sales for which the distributor's sale price is less than the amount they paid the manufacturer for the product.154 When submitting chargeback requests to manufacturers, distributors must provide manufacturers with information indicating how much product was sold and to whom.    122.1 have come to understand that there are significant limitations regarding chargeback data that make it ill-suited for use in a suspicious order monitoring program.155    a.   By the time manufacturers receive chargeback data from the distributor about a distributor-to-dispenser sale, that sale has already taken place. There is no opportunity for the manufacturer to ""halt"" or otherwise impact the transaction.    152    MNK-T10000270020 (Eileen Spaulding emails Karen Harper about a conversation with DI Heather White, who stated that she called NYC and no one there including Diversion Program Manager Sue Baker has heard anything about ""know your customers' customer"" and that the regulations do not reflect such a requirement.); Harper Dep.

PagelD #: 127966    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    b.   Manufacturers do not get chargeback data when they sell directly to the distribution centers of retail pharmacy chains.    c.    The data includes only that manufacturer's. Therefore, the data provides no context - e.g., it does not show what other opioids or non-opioid products manufactured by others the pharmacy is purchasing.    d.    The data only contains information about product the distributor shipped to the dispenser. It contains no information about how, by whom, or to whom the product is prescribed.    123.   Similarly, based on my experience in the industry, it was not standard practice for manufacturers to utilize prescription data for anti-diversion efforts. Prescription data does not show ""orders"" and DEA never suggested to industry that this data should be collected by manufacturers, analyzed as if they were orders, or utilized for anti-diversion purposes generally.    124.  Based on my experience within DEA and as a compliance consultant for industry, there was no industry standard of monitoring downstream transaction or purchases and no expectation that that would be part of an anti-diversion and/or suspicious order monitoring program during this time.    4.        2010-2011 Mallinckrodt Program    125.  In 2010 and 2011, Mallinckrodt continued to enhance its suspicious order monitoring program. At the same time, Mallinckrodt worked to create leading anti-diversion practices that allowed it to not only find out information about its customers but also find out information about downstream registrants that purchased Mallinckrodt product from Mallinckrodt's customers. I have reviewed Mallinckrodt's continuing enhancements and efforts to expand its anti-diversion program and evaluated that program and its efforts with respect to monitoring transactional data.    126.  As previously discussed, in 2009, in connection with the Sunrise audit, Mallinckrodt's Controlled Substances Compliance group became aware that its finance department possessed chargeback data to reconcile some downstream transactions.156 Mallinckrodt began to explore and evaluate the potential of using this financial data in its anti-diversion efforts. In 2010, Mallinckrodt began to see public news reports of diversion in Florida and its finance team undertook an analysis of this downstream data. Mallinckrodt discovered that its chargeback data could be used to help it better know its customers.157 While not all customers submit chargeback data on all downstream transactions, the transactions that were visible in the chargeback data showed the name and DEA number of the downstream entity, the type of product sold, the volume of product sold, the date    Harper Dep. Tr. at 353:9-20. Harper Dep. Tr. at 360:2-16.    -30-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 35 of 43.  PagelD #: 127967    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    of the sale.158 By understanding where its customers were selling Mallinckrodt product, Mallinckrodt was better equipped to scrutinize its customers' business practices.    127.  Based on what it learned from the chargeback data about customers' sales into the state of Florida, Mallinckrodt then took proactive steps with respect to three particular customers - Keysource, Masters, and Cedardale159 - that were shipping Mallinckrodt product to Florida. First, Mallinckrodt requested that the customers cease shipping oxycodone 15 mg and 30 mg dosage units to certain pharmacies and demanded an explanation for these sales.160 Then, Mallinckrodt conducted formal audits of all three customers.161 Finally, Mallinckrodt informed DEA about the steps it was taking with respect to each customer.162 Based on my experience, Mallinckrodt's customer audits went above and beyond common practices for manufacturers at the time, and set the industry standard for manufacturer audits of distributors.    128.  Despite conflicting suggestions from the DEA St. Louis Field Office and the DEA Albany Field Office about manufacturers knowing their customers' customers (see paragraphs 118-119) and no further guidance from DEA about what this meant or how to implement it, Mallinckrodt forged ahead to attempt to integrate chargeback data into its anti-diversion program to better understand where its products were being distributed.163 The Controlled Substances Compliance group worked closely with the finance department to run chargeback data reports, understand what the data showed and what to look for in the voluminous data, and evaluate whether and how the data could be incorporated in the anti-diversion program.    129.  Based on my review of documents and testimony, Mallinckrodt developed a chargeback monitoring program that went above and beyond DEA expectations. The program periodically reviewed chargeback data to look for high volume pharmacies or pharmacies whose transactional patterns raised questions. The program also reviewed certain other media and publically available information to identify downstream registrants that may pose a risk of diversion. Mallinckrodt shared its new chargeback monitoring initiative with the DEA St. Louis Field Office in 2010 and received feedback from the Diversion Program Manager that ""the information Mallinckrodt presented was the best Suspicious Order Monitoring process he has seen to date and what he expected from Mallinckrodt as an industry leader.""164    158 Buthusiem Rep. at 3-6.

PagelD #: 127968    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    130.  As part of this chargeback monitoring program, Mallinckrodt developed the ""chargeback restriction,"" a mechanism to disincentivize Mallinckrodt's customers from selling Mallinckrodt product to downstream pharmacies that may pose a risk of diversion.165 If Mallinckrodt decided to restrict chargebacks to a pharmacy, it would send a letter to distributors and to DEA, informing the distributors that it would not pay chargebacks to distributors who sold its product to the restricted pharmacy, in an effort to raise awareness of that pharmacy and spur further action by the distributors and perhaps DEA. Mallinckrodt did not have enough information to determine whether diversion was taking place, but used the chargeback restriction mechanism to identify the pharmacies for distributors and DEA based on its limited view through the chargeback data. In 2011, Mallinckrodt chargeback restricted more than thirty pharmacies in Florida and more than twenty pharmacies in other states.166    131.  In spring 2011, Mallinckrodt sought a meeting with DEA headquarters to share the work that it was doing on chargeback review and monitoring and its audits of distributors. On August 23, 2011, Mallinckrodt representatives from compliance, legal, and security met with DEA Office of Diversion Control and Quota section in Washington, DC.167 After Mallinckrodt presented its anti-diversion program, DEA asked Mallinckrodt to focus its anti-diversion efforts on its largest distributors and do more to address oxycodone diversion in Florida. 168    132.  After the meeting with DEA, Mallinckrodt took action immediately, both with respect to its own customers and with respect to downstream registrants. Mallinckrodt put together a plan to: (1) promptly suspend sales of Mallinckrodt oxycodone 15 mg and 30 mg tablets to distributors located in Florida; (2) set up in-person meetings with the larger distributors; (3) use chargeback data to identify the pharmacies purchasing the largest amounts of Mallinckrodt oxycodone 15 mg and 30 mg tablets inside and outside of Florida from Mallinckrodt's four largest distributor customers; (4) meet with those distributors and ask them to share their due diligence on each of those pharmacies; (5) conduct site-visits to certain Florida and Nevada pharmacies on that list to evaluate distributors' customer due diligence files on those pharmacies; and (6) chargeback restrict those pharmacies that Mallinckrodt believed, after its investigation and review of distributors' customer due diligence files, represented an unacceptable risk of diversion.169    133.  Based on my review of the documents and testimony, Mallinckrodt followed through on these plans.   Mallinckrodt suspended shipments as planned, met with its four largest    165 Ratliff Dep.

Mallinckrodt's security director at the time, Bill Ratliff, testified that ""the very next week I was in Florida... two of our forensic auditors to cover the east side of the state, because they had Spanish speaking ability, and I covered the west side of the state.""170 By early October 2011, Ratliff and his team had visited at least twenty pharmacies in Florida and Nevada.171 In September 2011 and again in November 2011, Mallinckrodt restricted chargebacks to distributors in connection with sales to certain pharmacies in and outside of Florida and shared those restriction letters with DEA.172 Throughout the fall of 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, Mallinckrodt remained in regular communication with DEA and provided updates on its actions and initiatives.173    134. I understand that in late 2010, Mallinckrodt retained Howard Davis as a consultant to assist the company in continuing to enhance and improve Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring program.174 It is my opinion that Mr. Davis's analysis and recommendations to Mallinckrodt175 made incorrect conclusions about Mallinckrodt's program, applied incorrect standards, and made incorrect recommendations for Mallinckrodt that were not consistent with DEA guidance to manufacturers or with industry standards at the time. For example, Mr. Davis copied and pasted a number of recommendations included in DEA guidance letters from 2006 and 2007 that related solely to distributors' pharmacy customers. For instance, Mr. Davis recommended that Mallinckrodt ask its distributor customers questions that were clearly meant for pharmacies, such as whether insurance plans are accepted and whether their customers are soliciting purchasers via the internet.176 Mr. Davis further suggested that Mallinckrodt ask its customers whether they self-medicated or were prescribing to family members.177 These recommendations demonstrate that Mr. Davis appears to have had no understanding of Mallinckrodt's business and was unable to comprehend the various entities that make up the controlled substances supply chain. In short, given Mr. Davis's lack of knowledge and understanding of the very manufacturing business upon which he was expected to consult, I conclude that any guidance he provided to Mallinckrodt was severely flawed and he did not add value as a consultant to the company.    170 Ratliff Dep.

It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances in the 2010-2011 time period.    136.  It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA in the 2010-2011 time period.    137.  It is my opinion that in the 2010-2011 time period Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program.    138.  It is my opinion that DEA guidance and industry standards evolved in the 2010-2011 time period and Mallinckrodt enhanced and upgraded its suspicious order monitoring and anti-diversion program to meet this changing DEA guidance and industry standards.    D.        2012 to 2018: Continuing Evolution and Enhancement    1.         2012-2018 Regulatory Landscape    139.  From 2012 to the present, there has been no change to the CSA's anti-diversion requirements or suspicious order monitoring regulation.178 Accordingly, consistent with prior years, neither the CSA nor the suspicious order monitoring regulation suggested that manufacturers needed to take any action to police the supply chain beyond the orders from their customers.    2.         2012-2018 DEA Guidance    140.  In the post-2012 time period, there has also been no further official guidance from DEA concerning anti-diversion and suspicious order monitoring obligations. In June 2012, DEA published a guidance letter reiterating the same information as the December 2007 letter.179 The June 2012 DEA Letter does not mention or suggest to manufacturers that they should know their customers' customers, and does not mention or suggest any obligation to collect, maintain, and utilize downstream transactional data as part of their anti-diversion or suspicious order monitoring programs. Essentially, the state of official DEA guidance remains unchanged since 2007.180    3.         2012-2018 Industry Standards    141.  Because DEA offered no further guidance, industry standards remained largely the same in the 2012-2018 time period. Based on my experience within DEA and as a compliance consultant for industry, there was no industry standard at this time for manufacturers to    178 Rannazzisi Dep. Tr.

Correct."").    179 ABDCMDL00269683.    180  Mr. Rafalski heavily relies on the Masters Pharmaceuticals decision in creating additional suspicious order monitoring obligations for registrants that are not stated in any regulations or DEA guidance. The Masters decision is not relevant to my opinions because it came out in 2017 and does not apply retroactively, and Mallinckrodt's program was consistent with the Masters decision.    -34-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 39 of 43.  PagelD #: 127971    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    monitor downstream registrants that purchased their product from distributors, and no expectation that such activity would be part of a compliance or suspicious order monitoring program during this time. In addition, it was not standard industry practice for manufacturers to collect, maintain, or utilize any downstream transactional data for anti-diversion purposes because DEA had never mentioned the possibility of using downstream transactional data for these purposes.    4.        2012-2018 Mallinckrodt Program181    142.  In 2012, Mallinckrodt further enhanced its anti-diversion and suspicious order monitoring efforts. First, Mallinckrodt revised its suspicious order monitoring algorithm to generate reports twice each business day, flagging orders based on number of orders per month and volume of orders per month.182 In September 2012, ""Do Not Ship"" controls were made automatic instead of manual so that an order could not be shipped while investigation was ongoing.183 In November 2012, the algorithm changed fromf! I         |, increasing the number of flagged orders, all of which Mallinckrodt conducted due diligence on prior to shipment.184 Mallinckrodt reported all flagged orders to DEA, sending reports twice each business day.185 Mallinckrodt has made continued revisions and improvements to its suspicious order monitoring process and procedures since 2012, the most recent in 2018.186    143.  In 2012, Mallinckrodt also expanded its customer audits, including audits of larger distributors.187    144.  Mallinckrodt also continued to restrict chargebacks to distributors in connection with sales by distributors to pharmacies nationwide that may be indicative of diversion.188 Each year from 2012 to the present, the company periodically identified pharmacies across the country to chargeback-restrict.189 Mallinckrodt formalized the chargeback restriction process and developed pharmacy information sheets to standardize the pharmacy investigation process.190 As discussed above, whenever Mallinckrodt put a pharmacy on its chargeback restriction list, it provided notice to all of Mallinckrodt's distributor customers as well as DEA.    1811 understand that neither Mr. Rafalski nor Dr. Whitelaw offer an opinion on Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program after 2012 and no Plaintiffs' experts claim that Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program did not meet DEA requirements and expectations after 2012.    82 MNK-T1_0002357607.    83 MNK-T1_0002357607.    84 MNK-T1_0005620500.    85 E.g., MNK-T10008509735; MNK-T1JJ002255019; MNK-T10008436462.    86   MNK-T10007476261   (October 2012  policy);  MNK-T10005620500   (November 2012  policy);  MNK-T10000511246 (2015 policy); MNK-T10004155833 (2018 policy).    87 MNK-T1_0008435608; MNKT1_0007727911. 88MNK-T1_0001384980.    89 MNK-T1_0008502183; MNK-T1_0007727449; MNK-T1_0007705938.    90 MNK-T10004155830; MNK-T1_0004155827.    -35-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 40 of 43.  PagelD #: 127972    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    145.  As an example of the chargeback restriction process, in October 2015, European Apothecary pharmacy came to Mallinckrodt's attention via media reports. Jennifer Buist of the Controlled Substances Compliance group consulted chargeback data and then sent distributors AmerisourceBergen, Bellco, and HD Smith a pharmacy information sheet requesting due diligence on European Apothecary.191 Bellco shortly thereafter returned the pharmacy information sheet, indicating that European Apothecary had been recently restricted internally due to similar media reports.192 Immediately after receiving the pharmacy information sheet from Bellco, Buist recorded this information about European Apothecary and contacted the appropriate colleagues to implement a chargeback restriction. Mallinckrodt sent a chargeback restriction letter concerning European Apothecary to all distributors.193 Mallinckrodt reported the chargeback restriction to DEA as well.194    146.  It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt maintained sufficient and effective controls against diversion of controlled substances 2012 to 2018.    147.  It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt's suspicious order monitoring system was sufficient and effective to detect and report suspicious orders to DEA from 2012 to 2018.    148.  It is my opinion that Mallinckrodt appropriately utilized the information and data available to it in its controlled substances compliance program and its suspicious order monitoring program from 2012 to 2018.    VIII. Mallinckrodt's 2017 Settlement Does Not Establish Or Recognize Any ""Know Your Customers' Customers"" Requirement And Does Not Change Opinion Regarding Mallinckrodt's Compliance With The CSA    149.  Based on my review of documents and deposition testimony in this case and Mallinckrodt's Memorandum of Agreement with DEA, Mallinckrodt made a limited admission in 2017 that at certain times prior to January 1, 2012, its program did not meet the standards outlined in the DEA guidance letters.195 Mallinckrodt does not admit that it has any obligation to know its customers' customers or monitor downstream transactional data.196 In the MO A, Mallinckrodt agreed to two different tasks: suspicious order reporting, required by DEA regulation, and chargeback monitoring, not required by DEA regulation.197    150.  In my experience with DEA and in industry, it is common for an entity to agree to a Memorandum of Agreement in order to avoid the burden of litigation and resolve a disagreement with the agency.    0002265146; MNK-T10001810925.    0002265149.    0007727449; MNK-T1_0007727447.    0002261388.    0000557100.    0000557100.    0000557100.    191 MNK-T1    192 MNK-T1    193 MNK-T1    194 MNK-T1    195 MNK-T1    196 MNK-T1    197 MNK-T1    -36-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP Doc #: 1957-35 Filed: 07/23/19 41 of 43.  PagelD #: 127973    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    151.  In my experience with DEA and in industry, it is possible for an entity to agree in a Memorandum of Agreement to do more than the relevant statute and regulations require. Furthermore, a Memorandum of Agreement is not binding on third parties and does not have the force of law.    152.  In my opinion, Mallinckrodt's limited admission in the 2017 settlement with DEA does not change my opinion that Mallinckrodt's anti-diversion program was consistent with anti-diversion regulations, guidance, and industry standards throughout the Review Period.    EX.      McCann and Keller Methodologies for Flagging Transactions    153.  I have also reviewed the Report and Supplemental Reports of Plaintiffs' experts Dr. Craig McCann and Lacy Keller. Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller claim to utilize five methodologies for identifying orders that could have been flagged within DEA's ARCOS data and Defendants' transaction data. Dr. McCann terms these methods as: ""Maximum Monthly, Trailing 6 Month Threshold,"" ""2x Trailing 12 Month average,"" ""Extraordinary Order Method - 3x Trailing 12 Month Average,"" ""Maximum 8,000 Dosage Units Monthly,"" and ""Maximum Daily Dosage Units.""198 These methodologies are pulled from Mr. Rafalski's expert report and no reason is given as to why any of these methodologies would be appropriate for any particular Defendant.199    154.  Neither Dr. McCann nor Ms. Keller offer any opinion as to whether any of the ""flagged"" transactions are, in fact, suspicious under the DEA' suspicious order monitoring regulation. However, Mr. Rafalski, without any analysis, simply adopts the analyses of both Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller and contends that each of the flagged orders is, in fact, suspicious.200 Each of these reports rests on assumptions that are fundamentally flawed. Notably, as both DEA and industry understood, suspicious order monitoring is not one-size-fits all. Each and every registrant has a different business model and different customer base. Therefore, attempting to apply simplistic formulas across numerous registrants without conducting an actual evaluation of each registrant's business model and customer base does not provide an accurate way to evaluate that registrant's orders. In fact, the flaws in this approach are highlighted by the fact that Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller apply the exact same formulas to both distributor and manufacturer registrants. As discussed earlier in this report, these different registrant classes have very different business models and customer bases. A manufacturer may sell to a few dozen distributors while a distributor may sell to tens of thousands of retail pharmacies. Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller simply ignore these essential differences. Throughout my experience, I understood that each registrant needed to be evaluated individually, and one could not apply a single suspicious order monitoring program to different registrants, and certainly not to difference classes of registrants. The regulatory guidance provided by DEA makes this fact clear as DEA expected each registrant to create its own system to determine when orders were actually suspicious.201 As such, the methodologies utilized    McCann Rep. at 56-72; Keller Rep. at 16-22. Rafalski Rep. at 41. Rafalski Rep. at 40-41. US-DEA-00001767; US-DEA-00005941.    -37-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 42 of 43.  PagelD #: 127974    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    by Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller are merely a subset of the various ways by which a registrant could analyze orders for further diligence as part of its suspicious order monitoring program.    155.  More importantly, Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller both base their reports on a flawed premise - that the registrants did not effectively investigate the flagged transactions. This assumption is based solely on the instruction of Plaintiffs' counsel as neither Dr. McCann nor Ms. Keller conducted any review of any Defendants' due diligence files.202 As such, neither Dr. McCann nor Ms. Keller has any idea whether the orders flagged by the methodologies were in fact investigated by the registrants.    156.  Furthermore, both Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller take this flawed assumption to an extreme and untenable position. As soon as one order is flagged, Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller assume that all subsequent orders should be flagged and again that no due diligence was conducted. I have never heard of such an approach to suspicious order monitoring. The CSA, DEA regulations, DEA guidance, and industry standards have never instructed or required manufacturers and distributors to stop selling controlled substances to a customer if one of that customer's orders is flagged by its suspicious order monitoring algorithm. In addition, this position appears to utilize a ""suspicious customer"" approach, whereas the applicable DEA regulation clearly is focused on monitoring and reporting individual orders. These flawed assumptions cause Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller to immensely overstate the number of orders flagged by each of their flawed methods. In short, the analyses done by Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller have no basis and are simply created based on faulty assumptions by Plaintiffs. I do not believe that they provide any useful information in evaluating the Defendants' suspicious order monitoring programs.    157.  It is my opinion that a suspicious order monitoring system that meets the regulations and expectations of DEA must be tailored to each individual registrant's business and the one-size-fits-all approach that Plaintiffs' counsel asked Dr. McCann and Ms. Keller to apply in their expert reports in this case is incorrect, is contrary to DEA guidance, and does not provide any useful information relating to suspicious orders for each of the Defendants.    202    Keller Rep. at 14; McCann Rep. at 20.    -38-     Case: l:17-md-02804-DAP  Doc #: 1957-35  Filed:  07/23/19 43 of 43.

And what is your occupation,    18   and who is your employer?    19         A.     I'm currently a vice president    20   of regulatory affairs and compliance for    21   McKesson Corporation.    22         Q.     How long have you been employed    23   by McKesson?    24         a.     Since May of 2014.    25         Q.     Have you ever had your    12   Q.    13   A.    14   Q.    15   A.

So if you'll bear with me,    6   we're going to do a little bit of paperwork    7   to start --to start off.    8         A.     Okay.    9         Q.     The first thing is, is are you    10   aware that today you'll be testifying not as    11   Nate Hartle but as McKesson Corporation?    12         a.     I am.    13                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 1    14         marked for identification.)    15   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    16         Q.     I'm going to have marked and    17   show you McKesson 30(b)(6) Document 1, and    18   this is the first notice of deposition that    19   was filed in this case.    2 0                                     Have you had a chance to review    21   this document before today?    22         a.     I do.  I have copies of this.    23          Q.     And you understand that today    24   I'll be asking you questions about the    25   subject matters that are in Exhibit 1, and    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^WiJfefitte$o <%G&Mk�*c$�?2a8?@m$t�$�&.    tew    1   McKesson has been kind enough to designate    2   you as its spokesman to answer these    3   questions?    4   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    5   THE WITNESS:  I understand.    6   (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 2    7   marked for identification.)    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9   Q.     There's a second notice.  We'll    10   have that marked as Exhibit 2, and it's MCK    11   30(b)(6)_02.    12   Have you had a chance to review    13   this document before today?    14   A.     I have.    15   Q.     Now, it's my understanding that    16   McKesson has designated you to testify on    17   certain subject matters within this document    18   but not all.    19   Is that your understanding?    20   A.     Correct.    21   Q.     And those numbers are numbers    22   9, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22.    23   Is that your understanding as    24   well?    25   A.     Yes.

FARRELL:    4         Q.     The next document, just to be    5   fair, is I'm going to mark as Exhibit 3    6   McKesson's objections and responses to each    7   of these subject matters to create the whole    8   record, if anybody wants to see it.  This    9   will be McKesson 30(b)(6)_3.    10                 Have you had a chance to review    11   this document before today?    12         a.     I have.    13          Q.     It's much longer, isn't it?    14                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 4    15         marked for identification.)    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     And finally, I'm going to show    18   you McKesson 3 0(b)(6)_4, which we've also    19   labeled as Exhibit 4, which is simply the    20   redesignation of the date and location and    21   the subject matters of today's deposition.    22                 Have you had a chance to review    23   this document?    24         a.     I have.    25                         Q.             So  that   everybody   is   on  the    Golkow  Litigation  Services    Page   18     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o ^G&Mk2Q&�?2d8?@m$t�$�&iew    1   same page, what you'll notice is that there    2   are a number of different Bates stamps that    3   we'll see throughout the day.  For purposes    4   of this deposition, what we've done is we've    5   created a unique and separate Bates stamp    6   just for your deposition, which can be found    7   in the top right-hand corner of, I hope, all    8   of the exhibits today.  And some of them,    9   start MCK 30(b)(6) and then underscore, and    10   then the first number you'll see is the    11   sequential number of exhibits, followed by a    12   dash and then individual page numbers.    13                 As we go through later today, I    14   abandon the normal sequential numbering    15   system because we're going to bounce around    16   the timeline a little bit, and instead I use    17   basically a date indicator in the top    18   right-hand corner.    19         A.     Okay.    20         Q.     Now, that being said for    21   everybody on the telephone, a lot of these    22   documents have been produced in this    23   litigation, and what you'll find, to the best    24   of my ability, is I've always tried to find    25   the document that contains the MDL Bates    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 19     Case: fr�^m$-CmtM&&m#---1W�>^�i\e�o<%{&&&&<$�?2a8?@m$t�$&&.ew    1   stamp in the bottom right-hand corner.    2   Sometimes it's not been all that successful    3   because sometimes the document comes from a    4   prior production and has not yet matriculated    5   or made its way over to the MDL production.    6                 But nonetheless, those are the    7   three different Bates stamp numbering systems    8   that we're going to come across today, and    9   when I talk on the record, I'll try to refer    10   just to the MDL number.    11                 For the people on the telephone    12   and the record and then for you and I, it'll    13   be easiest for us to use the top right-hand    14   corner.    15         A.     Okay.    16         Q.     When did you first learn that    17   you would be designated as the corporate    18   witness for McKesson?    19         a.     I don't know the exact date,    20   but I believe within the last, say, 30 days    21   or so.    2 2        Q.     Do you know Gary Boggs? 2 3        A.     I do know Gary.    24         Q.     Are you aware that he has been    25   designated as a 30(b)(6) designee in another    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 0     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%{&&&22<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1   litigation pending in West Virginia?    2         A.     I am aware.    3          Q.     Have you read the deposition of    4   McKesson from that litigation?    5         A.     I have.    6         Q.     Is there anything in that    7   deposition that you think is wrong or    8   factually inaccurate?    9         A.     Not that I can recall.    10         Q.     Are you prepared, sitting here    11   today, to adopt or affirm the representations    12   McKesson made in the West Virginia Attorney    13   General litigation?    14                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    15                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    16          again, please?    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     So it's a little bit of a    19   Plato's Theory of the Forms right now, but    20   for all intents and purposes, McKesson is    21   sitting here in front of me today, and    22   McKesson was sitting before Mr. Lee Javins    23   from the West Virginia Attorney General    24   litigation pending in Boone County several    25   weeks ago.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 21     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^WiJfefitte$o <%G&Mk23&�?2a8?@m$t�$�&.    tew    1   And so I'm trying to make the    2   connection that sitting here today McKesson    3   affirms or adopts all of its testimony from    4   the West Virginia litigation.    5   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6   This witness is here on -- designated    7   on behalf of McKesson for the topics    8   you've indicated.    9   But you can answer the    10   question.    11   THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure how    12   to answer that question.    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14   Q.     Okay.  So the answer is either    15   you adopt your testimony from the prior    16   litigation or you choose not to today.    17   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19   Q.     It's okay either way.    20   A.     What's that?    21   Q.     It's okay either way.    22   A.     Yeah.    23   Q.     It's just a question of whether    24   or not I'm going to go back through some of    25   the other subject matters that Gary Boggs    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 2     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o^G&Mk2/k$�?2d8?@m$t�$�&iew    1      testified  to  or whether  or  not   I   can  rely  on    2      that   sworn  testimony   --    3                       A.            Okay.    4         Q.     -- to be applicable today.    5                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form,    6          and same comment as I made before.    7                 MR. FARRELL:  So, Counsel,    8          that's your second speaking objection,    9         and so I would ask that you keep your    10          comments from the record.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     So it's okay if you do not want    13   to adopt that prior testimony.  We can go    14   through it today.  You may not have the    15   authority by McKesson to do so.    16         A.     Yeah.  Again, I'm not sure how    17   to answer that question specifically.    18         Q.     It's not a problem.    19         a.     Yeah.  Okay.    2 0        Q.     Can you tell me what documents    21   you reviewed to prepare for today's    22   testimony?    23                 MS. HENN:  I'm going to object    24          to that question as calling for    25         attorney work product and instruct the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 3     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o ^{&L#k25&�?2a8?@m$t�$&Piew    1         witness not to respond if you're being    2          asked, as I understand you are, for a    3          list of documents counsel showed you.    4   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    5         Q.     Okay.  Have all of the    6   documents that counsel shared with McKesson    7   been disclosed in the MDL?    8                 MS. HENN:  Do you mean to ask    9         whether the documents Mr. Hartle has    10         used in preparing for the deposition,    11         have they been produced?    12                 MR. FARRELL:  Yes.    13                 MS. HENN:  I believe that to be    14          the case, yes.    15   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    16         Q.     Okay.  So is it fair to say    17   that everything Mr. Hartle reviewed has    18   actually been produced in the litigation    19   today?    20                 MS. HENN:  That is my    21         understanding.    22                 MR. FARRELL:  The reason I ask    23          is because when I read Mr. Boggs'    24          testimony, there are references to a    25         dozen or so documents that he relied    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 24     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o^G&Mk2%$�?2a8?@m$t�m}-iew    1                    upon  and discussed that  have  not  yet    2                    been  disclosed  in  the MDL.    3                                   Are  you  aware   of   any  documents    4                    that  are  pending  that  have  not  been    5         produced?    6                 MS. HENN:  I know that we're    7         not complete with our productions, but    8          I'm not -- I don't know what those    9         documents -- what documents you're    10          referring to.    11                 MR. FARRELL:  So to the extent    12          that there are future documents that    13          are produced that are relevant to the    14          subject matters that are in the    15          30(b) (6) notices, we reserve our right    16          to petition the Court for good cause    17          to extend or continue this deposition.    18                 MS. HENN:  I note your    19          reservation of rights.  We may    20         disagree on the ability of plaintiffs    21          to continue this deposition, but let's    22          continue.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Other than the documents    25   provided by counsel to you in preparation for    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 5     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b <%G&Mk&&�?2d8?@m$t��&iew    1   this deposition, did you on your own review    2   any documents?    3         A.     Yes, I reviewed a handful of    4   documents that are standard with our program.    5         Q.     Okay.  Can you tell me which    6   ones they are?    7         A.     Can I ask a clarifying    8   question?  Can you repeat --do the documents    9   that had already -- documents that haven't    10   been produced?  Anything in addition to    11   what --    12         Q.     That would be a swell place to    13   start.    14         a.     You know, as I think about    15   things that I've reviewed, it's standard    16   operating manuals and procedures, and I think    17   likely all that -- that stuff is part of what    18   was produced, so I don't --    19         Q.     That's actually not a very fair    20   way to place it because you probably haven't    21   studied the production list yet from    22   McKesson.    23         A.      No.  No.    24         Q.     So let's talk about it in a    25   different context.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 6     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b<%G&Mk2*&�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1         A.     Okay.    2         Q.     I'm assuming at some point in    3   time your counsel provided you some documents    4   that they culled through based upon the legal    5   documents, and that, arguably, has been the    6   subject of some debate between the lawyers on    7   whether that list is producible or not.    8                 Aside from that, did you    9   independently go and review anything on your    10   own, document-wise, to prepare for today?    11         A.     Document-wise?  You know, I    12   looked at files of mine, you know, just, you    13   know, what I -- what I have in my own, you    14   know, storage on things that I've done or    15   projects that I've been on and reviewed just    16   a variety of different pieces of information    17   that personally I have.    18         Q.     Where would those files be    19   located?    2 0        A.     On my computer, whether it be    21   e-mails or in documents on my standard    22   storage on my computer.    23          Q.     Would it be documents from    24   MCK.NET?    25         A.     I don't think there was    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 7     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b <%G&Mk2%$�?2a8?@m$t�$&fc.ew    1       anything  stored  on  MCK.NET,   our   intra   --   the    2       company's   intra   site.    3                    Q.           I   just  wanted  to  say MCK.NET.    4         A.     MCK.NET, yeah.    5         Q.     Did you review documents that    6   were on your personal computer -- that's a    7   bad question.    8                 Did you review documents that    9   are located on your hard drive of your    10   computer?    11         A.     My work computer?    12         Q.     Yes.    13         a.     Yes.    14         Q.     Would those documents also have    15   been on the server?    16         A.     Could you clarify ""server""?    17         Q.     Yeah.  So in general, when you    18   have a network of computers, sometimes    19   there's a central repository where    20   everybody's computer can pull up files from,    21   and then there's also on your own computer a    22   hard drive that nobody else can look at,    23   except you, from your computer station.    24         a.     I understand that, sir, but    25   I -- you know, in terms of the shared    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 8     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b ^G&Mk2Q&�?2d8?@m$t��&iew    1   repository that we use in regulatory affairs,    2   yes, there's documents stored on there that    3   I've reviewed.    4         Q.     What about documents on your    5   personal hard drive on your office computer?    6         A.     Yes, I store documents on my    7   personal office computer.    8         Q.     And those documents you    9   reviewed prior to today's deposition?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  There are some    12          documents.    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14         Q.     Did you rely on any of those    15   documents or did any of those documents    16   refresh your recollection about the subject    17   matters of today's deposition?    18         a.     I used --    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form. 2 0                                      Go ahead.    21                 THE WITNESS:  I used them to    22          refresh.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Okay.  How about e-mails?  Did    25   you go and review any old e-mails?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 2 9     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk2l<$�?2a8?@m$t�$&&.ew    1         A.     I may have looked at a few    2   e-mails.    3          Q.     Do any of them particularly    4   stand out?    5         A.     No.    6         Q.     who would the e-mails have come    7   from that you were reviewing?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  Could be a    10         variety of people.  I don't recall,    11         you know, specific e-mails that I    12          looked at.  Could be from my team or    13         part of a project or...    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     And I'm sorry if I asked this    16   before.  How long have you been with    17   McKesson?    18         A.     Since 2014.  May of 2014.    19         Q.     You understand that some of the    20   subject matters today may predate 2014?    21         A.     I do understand that.    22         Q.     Other than documents provided    23   by your lawyer, where did you find documents    24   that predated 2014?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 0     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o <%{&&&22<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1                 THE WITNESS:  They would be on    2          our shared drive or our space where    3          regulatory affairs -- it's called the    4         R drive.  That's where we would share    5          information.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     Okay.  Other than the R drive,    8   where else would we find those documents?    9                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10                 THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure -- I    11         don't believe I accessed anything else    12          outside of the hard drive.  I know    13          there's other sites, a share point    14          site in the past, but I believe mine    15         were all from the R drive.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     Have you reviewed any documents    18   or seen any documents that predate 2006?    19         a.     I have.    2 0        Q.     And did you -- where did those    21   documents come from?    22                 I'll make it easier.  Did those    23   documents come from the lawyers?    24         a.     I have some in the -- the -- my    25   preparation over the past few days, but also    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 31     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b<%G&Mk23&�?2a8?@m$t�$&&.ew    1   I do have documents, as I joined McKesson,    2   that I reviewed and had stored either on my    3   personal computer, on my work computer, or    4   the R drive that predate 2006.    5         Q.     All right.  So we're going to    6   jump into some topics.    7         A.     Okay.    8         Q.     Have you read the Masters    9   Pharmaceutical case?    10         a.     Not for a while.  I read it    11   when it first came out, you know.    12         Q.     That was June of 2 017.    13                 So when I start asking    14   questions, I'm going to do my very best to    15   keep envisioning McKesson's logo sitting in    16   front of me instead of Nate Hartle.    17         a.     Okay.    18         Q.     So let me ask a different way.    19                 Is McKesson aware of the    20   publishing of the Masters Pharmaceutical    21   case?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    23                 THE WITNESS:  We are.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     You're aware that in Masters    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 32     Case: ni^hTf QS^ffm&&&#^Wt?fefitte$o ^G&Mk2/k$�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1      Pharmaceutical   there was  a  discussion  of  the    2      reporting  requirement?    3                       A.            I   am.    4         Q.     And does McKesson acknowledge    5   that is the law in the United States?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Could you ask    8          that question again, please?  Do I --    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Sure.    11                 I'm jumping out of order a    12   little bit, but I'm going to see if I can    13   actually grab the folder for you.    14                 We're not going to premark this    15   because that will absolutely mess up my    16   numbering system, but the top right-hand    17   corner it's Bates stamped 2017_06_30.    18                 And I apologize for the    19   flopping of the documents across the big    20   table.    21                 This is Masters Pharmaceutical.    22   Has McKesson read this document?    23                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    24                 THE WITNESS:  I believe that    25          several have read this document.

Have you read this document in    3   preparation for today's deposition?    4         A.     Did I have it in the past?    5         Q.     No.    6                 In preparation for today's    7   deposition, have you read this as McKesson's    8   corporate designee?    9         A.     I did not read this specific    10   right before the deposition.    11         Q.     So it's not -- it's not a    12   memory contest --    13         A.     Right.    14         Q.     -- and that's why I brought the    15   documents --    16         A.     Right.    17         Q.     --so that -- so that we can    18   talk about some of the subject matters.    19                 The first thing I'd like you to    20   do is turn to the Bates stamp page 7.  And    21   you'll notice that there are two columns, and    22   in the bottom right-hand corner the paragraph    23   heading number 2.    24                 Do you see that?    25         a.     Yes.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 34     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b<%G&Mk2%$�?2a8?@m$t�$miew    1         Q.     And midway down through, you'll    2   see that in the parentheses it says the    3   ""reporting requirement.""    4         A.     I see that.    5         Q.     Do you see it?    6         A.     I do.    7         Q.     And then immediately after    8   that, it describes what the reporting    9   requirement is.  And I don't know if you do    10   better reading it aloud or reading it to    11   yourself.    12                 Would you like me to read it,    13   or would you like to read it?    14         a.     I can read it.    15         Q.     All right.  Starting with ""the    16   reporting requirement is a relatively modest    17   one,"" will you finish the sentence?    18         a.     I read that sentence.    19         Q.     Okay.  Now, will you read it    20   aloud?    21         A.     ""It requires only that a    22   distributor provide basic information about    23   certain orders to DEA so that DEA    24   investigators in the field can aggregate    25   reports from every point along the legally    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 5     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk&&�?2a8?@m$t�mZiew    1   regulated supply chain and use the    2   information to ferret out potentially illegal    3   activity.""    4         Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that    5   it has a duty under the reporting    6   requirement?    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8                 THE WITNESS:  Acknowledge that    9         we -- we, as part of the designing and    10         operating the suspicious order system,    11         have to report suspicious orders.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     That wasn't my question.    14                 My question is:  Does McKesson    15   acknowledge the reporting requirement, as you    16   just read aloud, is a duty owed by McKesson    17   under the federal regulations and United    18   States Code?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  And it's our    21          responsibility to report suspicious    22          orders.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     So the answer to my question is    25   yes --    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 6     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^WiJfefitte$o<%G&Mk2*&�?2a8?@m$t�m?iew    1   A.   Yes.    2   Q.   -- no, or I don't know.    3      MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    4      THE WITNESS:  It is our -- yes.    5   QUESTIONS   BY MR. FARRELL:    6   Q.   Okay.  Now, I want you to go    7   down, and   if you actually flip the page,    8   we'll cheat to the end, and it's the end of     9   the first   sentence in the top left-hand    10   corner.   In parentheses it says, ""The    11   shipping   requirement.""    12      Do you see that?    13   A.   Where am I looking again?    14   Sorry.       15   Q.   Very top left-hand corner    16   there's a       17   A.   Okay.  Shipping requirement.  I    18   see that.       19   Q.   All right.  Now what we're    20   going to   do is go to the beginning of that    21   sentence   on the previous page, and it's the    22   last full   sentence.  It starts with ""once a    23   distribut   or has.""    24      Do you see that sentence?    25   A.   I see that.

Now I'm going to give you a    2   chance to read it without -- and digest it    3   for a second.    4         A.     I've read that.    5         Q.     All right.  Now, can you read    6   it aloud for the record?    7         A.     ""Once a distributor has    8   reported a suspicious order, it must make one    9   of two choices, decline to ship the order or    10   conduct some due diligence, and if it is able    11   to determine that the order is not likely to    12   be diverted into illegal channels, ship the    13   order.""    14         Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that    15   the shipping requirement is a duty it owes    16   under the United States Code and the Code of    17   Federal Regulations?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    20                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 5    21         marked for identification.)    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     We'll come back to this later.    24                 All right.  The next document    25   we're going to reference is MCK 30(b)(6)_5.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 8     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o0?(^^^Q^i^?der^�Sft^f^lew    1       And  so  to make  this  easy  so  I   don't  have  to    2       say all   those   letters  and numbers,   as  we move    3       forward  I'm  just  going  to   refer  to   it   exhibit    4       such-and-such.    5                       A.            Okay.    6         Q.     And when I do, we're talking    7   about the exhibit for this deposition.    8                 I'm going to represent to you    9   that there are four pages to this exhibit,    10   that you won't find this exhibit anywhere on    11   the Internet because I made them myself.  I'm    12   going to give you a second to flip through    13   them, and what I'm going to represent to you    14   is that these are four different provisions    15   from four different United States Code    16   provisions.  So I'll give you a second to    17   review.    18         A.     Okay.    19         Q.     So the first thing I want you    20   to take note of on Exhibit 5, page 1, is the    21   top left-hand corner, which is the great seal    22   of our United States Congress.    23                 And if you look under the    24   United States Code, Title 21, for food and    25   drugs, under Chapter 13, Drug Abuse    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 9     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk�i<$�?2a8?@m$t�mfc.ew    1   Prevention and Control, Subchapter 1, Control    2   and Enforcement, Part A, Introductory    3   Provisions, this is the beginning of the    4   Controlled Substances Act.    5                 McKesson is aware of and    6   acknowledges that its role in the chain of    7   distribution of opioids is governed by the    8   Controlled Substances Act, agreed?    9                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     Now, I'm going to have you look    13   down all the way at all those letters and    14   numbers at the very bottom, Public Law    15   91-513, Title 2.  And the date there is    16   October 27, 1970.    17                 McKesson is aware that the    18   Controlled Substances Act has been in force    19   and effect since 1970, correct?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     So Section 801, which is on the    24   first page, is Congressional findings and    25   declarations regarding controlled substances.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 4 0     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk�2<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1                 Do you see that?    2         A.     I do.    3          Q.     And it says, ""The Congress    4   agrees makes the following findings and    5   declarations.""    6                 And to be fair, paragraph 1,    7   will you read it aloud?    8         A.     ""Many of the drugs included    9   within this subchapter have a useful and    10   legitimate medical purpose and are necessary    11   to maintain the health and general welfare of    12   the American people.""    13          Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge and    14   agree with that finding?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     Now, will you read Section 2    19   aloud, please?    20         a.     ""The illegal importation,    21   manufacture, distribution and possession and    22   improper use of controlled substances have    23   substantially and detrimentally effect --    24   have a substantial and detrimental effect on    25   the health and general welfare of the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 41     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o<%G&Mk�3&�?2a8?@m$t�m&.ew    1   American people.""    2         Q.

FARRELL:    7         Q.     So you'll notice in paragraph 2    8   it includes distribution, correct?    9         A.     Correct.    10         Q.     And McKesson is engaged in the    11   distribution business, agreed?    12         a.     We are.    13          Q.     And that if they do not follow    14   the law as provided by the US code and the    15   Code of Federal Regulations, it has a    16   substantial and detrimental effect on the    17   health and general welfare of the American    18   people, agreed?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Could you restate    21          that question for me, please?    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     Yeah.    24                 You agree with paragraph 2 --    25         A.     Right.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 4 2     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^Witfiifitte$o0?(S3&ferH$i#2der^�ift#t^�^ew    1         Q.     --as McKesson's    2   representative, correct?    3         A.     Correct.    4         Q.     And what it says is that the    5   illegal, and one of the words is    6   distribution, of controlled substances has a    7   substantial and detrimental effect on the    8   health and general welfare of the American    9   people.    10                 I'm asking you if McKesson    11   agrees and acknowledges with this finding by    12   Congress in 1970.    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Yes, that the    15          illegal distribution can -- could    16         potentially have an impact on the    17         American --    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     Well, it doesn't say    20   ""potential"" in paragraph 2, does it?    21         A.     It doesn't.    22         Q.     it says that if you break the    23   law, it has a substantial and detrimental    24   effect on the health and general welfare of    25   the American people.

That's  what   it   says,   correct.    2                       Q.            Does  McKesson  agree  and    3      acknowledge   that   finding?    4                                        MS.

Now, if you flip to page 2,    8   this is section A 12 of the Controlled    9   Substances Act, and what it says is it places    10   drugs into one of several categories.    11                 Is McKesson aware of the    12   scheduling of controlled substances?    13         a.     We are.    14         Q.     Okay.  And what we're dealing    15   with in this litigation primarily today are    16   Schedule II drugs, correct?    17         a.     Correct.    18         Q.     Now, there was a period of time    19   when certain hydrocodone combination products    20   were Schedule III, but they've since been    21   reclassified as Schedule II, agreed?    22         a.     Agreed.    23          Q.     And McKesson picked up a book    24   of business when that happened on the HCPs,    25   agreed?

HENN:  Objection to form.    2   THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase    3   the book of business and the question    4   a little bit?    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6   Q.     Yeah, that was a little too    7   country.    8   Is McKesson aware that its    9   sales of hydrocodone combination products    10   rose following the reclassification of those    11   opioids from Schedule III to Schedule II?    12   A.     Yes.    13   Q.     So nonetheless, when we're    14   talking about these products, I'm referencing    15   Schedule II for today.    16   A.     Understood.    17   Q.     So the Schedule II has a    18   definition, does it not, under the United    19   States Code?    20   A.     It does.    21   Q.     There's three aspects to it.    22   Do you see those three aspects?    23   A.     I do.    24   Q.     Could you read aspect A?    25   A.     ""The drug or other substance    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 4 5     Case: fr�^m$-CmtM&&m#---1W�>^�i\e�o<%G&Mk&&�?2d8?@m$t�$�&iew    1   has a high potential for abuse.""    2         Q.     McKesson is aware since 1970    3   that it was engaging in business of    4   distributing Schedule II controlled    5   substances which have a high potential for    6   abuse, agreed?    7         A.     Agreed.    8         Q.     And you agree that the opioids,    9   whether they're Schedule II or formerly    10   Schedule III, are drugs that have a high    11   potential for abuse?    12         a.     Agree.    13          Q.     McKesson knows this?    14         a.     We do.    15         Q.     And McKesson has known this    16   from the very beginning of their decision to    17   distribute controlled substances?    18         a.     Agreed.    19         Q.     Would you read paragraph B,    20   please?    21         A.     ""The drug or other substance    22   has a currently accepted medical use and    23   treatment in the United States or a currently    24   accept medical use with severe restrictions.""    25         Q.

""Abuse of a drug or other    8   substances may lead to severe psychological    9   or physical dependence.""    10         Q.

FARRELL:    15         Q.     So just to be clear, when we're    16   talking about controlled substances in this    17   litigation, we're talking about opiates and    18   opioids, agreed?    19         a.     Agreed.    20         Q.     And what these are, are these    21   are derivatives of opium in the form of a    22   pill, agreed?    23                 MS.

Well -- and it's okay if -- I'm    8   just trying to figure out what McKesson    9   knows.    10                 McKesson distributes pills from    11   a manufacturer to pharmacies.  That's what    12   they do, yes?    13         A.     Correct.    14         Q.     The pills that you're    15   distributing, you're aware they originally    16   come from the poppy plant?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18         Outside the scope.    19                 THE WITNESS:  I'm not an expert    20          in the medical field and design, but I    21         understand that, yes.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge or    24   appreciate that what they're selling are    25   opium pills?

HENN:      Objection  to   form.    2                                        THE  WITNESS:      We  understand    3                how   --   what's   in  the  pills,   so,   yes.    4   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    5         Q.     Okay.  So the opium can be    6   manipulated by the manufacturers to be    7   opiate-like?  Opiate-like, right?  There's    8   opiates and opioid, or opiate-like, and    9   that's how you get hydrocodone and oxycodone    10   and all the different types of opium pills,    11   agreed?    12         A.     Correct.    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     So when I say ""opium pills,""    16   what I'm talking about is the big    17   classification of all of these pills derived    18   from the poppy plant.    19                 Is that fair? 2 0        A.     Understood.    21         Q.     All right.  And when we talk    22   about any of the individual pills, whether    23   it's hydrocodone or oxycodone, those all fall    24   within the opium pill umbrella, right?    25                 MS.

FARRELL:    3          Q.     So when McKesson is    4   distributing opium pills, it knows and    5   understands that these pills have a high    6   potential for abuse?    7         A.     We do.    8         Q.     Now, they also -- you also --    9   McKesson understands that these pills do have    10   an accepted medical use in treatment, but    11   they have severe restrictions, agreed?    12                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13                 THE WITNESS:  We understand the    14          language, yes.    15   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    16         Q.     You understand the language of    17   paragraph B?    18         A.     Right.    19         Q.     Opium pills have a place in    20   current medical practice?    21         A.     Yes.    22         Q.     But abusing opium pills may    23   lead to severe psychological and physical    24   dependence?    25         A.     Correct.

Yes.    4         Q.     And that's why the unlawful    5   distribution of these opium pills, relating    6   back to page 1, has a substantial and    7   detrimental effect on the health and general    8   welfare of the American people.    9                 Does McKesson acknowledge that?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     Now we're going to flip to    14   page 3, which is Section 821, rules and    15   regulations.    16                 Will you please read this    17   aloud?    18         A.

What is the date?    4   A.     October 27, 1970.    5   Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that    6   Congress gave the United States Attorney    7   General the authority to promulgate rules    8   regarding the distribution of opium pills?    9   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10   THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12   Q.     Now let's flip to the next    13   page.  This is the -- this is where we'll be    14   spending most of our time today.  This is    15   page 4, Section 823.    16   This is from the United States    17   Code, and it includes, as you'll see down in    18   paragraph 1, what Congress has said is    19   McKesson's duty.  I'd like you to first read    20   that to yourself.    21   A.     I've read it.    22   Q.     All right.  Does McKesson    23   acknowledge that it has a duty to maintain    24   effective control against diversion of opium    25   pills as mandated by Congress?

FARRELL:    7         Q.     Now this is a much bigger    8   document, but I promise we won't go through    9   every page.    10                 This is going to be marked as    11   Exhibit 6 in the bottom right-hand corner,    12   and in the top right-hand corner it's MCK    13   30(b)(6)_6.    14                 For our fans following on the    15   telephone, this is the Congressional history    16   that can be found at 91-1444.  It is Public    17   Law 91-513.    18                 Do you remember when we were    19   looking at the United States Code and it    20   referenced Public Law 91-513 from Exhibit 5?    21         A.     Yes.    22         Q.     This is that document, I'll    23   represent to you.    24         a.     Okay.    25         Q.     And what this is, is this is    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 3     Case: fr�^m$-CmtM&&m#---1W�>^�i\e�o^G&Mk�5($�?2a8?@m$t��5Piew    1   the Congressional history of all those codes    2   that we just walked through.  And I'm not    3   going to ask you to read the entire document    4   because I've highlighted certain sections for    5   you.    6                 The first thing I'd like you to    7   do is I'd like for you to turn to Bates stamp    8   page 5.  And while you read the document to    9   yourself, I'm going to read it out loud to    10   save you some time.    11         A.     Okay.    12         Q.     Under Title 2, Control and    13   Enforcement, it states, ""The bill provides    14   for control by the Justice Department of    15   problems related to drug abuse through    16   registration of manufacturers, wholesalers,    17   retailers and all others in the legitimate    18   distribution chain and makes transactions    19   outside the legitimate distribution chain    20   illegal.""    21                 Does McKesson acknowledge this    22   finding from Congress?    23                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    24                 THE WITNESS:  Yes. 25    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 54     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk�%$�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2         Q.     I'm going to have you to turn    3   to Bates stamp page 8.  And again, these are    4   my highlights.  Congress didn't highlight    5   this in 1970; Paul Junior did.  So while you    6   read it, I'm going to read it out loud.    7                 ""The bill was designed to    8   improve the administration and regulation of    9   the manufacturing, distribution and    10   dispensing of controlled substances by    11   providing for a closed system of drug    12   distribution for legitimate handlers of such    13   drugs.  Such a closed system should    14   significantly reduce the widespread diversion    15   of these drugs out of the legitimate channels    16   into the illicit market, while at the same    17   time providing the legitimate drug industry    18   with a unified approach to narcotic and    19   dangerous drug control.""    20                 Does McKesson acknowledge the    21   truth of this finding by Congress?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    23                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     So let's just talk about this    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 5     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b<%G&Mk&&�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1   for a minute.    2                 McKesson understands that in    3   1970 Congress created a closed system,    4   agreed?    5         A.     Agree.    6         Q.     What a closed system means is    7   that laissez-faire economics don't apply,    8   agreed?    9                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Have to refresh    11         my memory on laissez-faire economics.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     It's just a fancy French word    14   for ""hands off.""  The government is    15   intervening in the marketplace of the chain    16   of distribution for opium pills, agreed?    17         a.     For controlled substances.    18         Q.     Well, for all controlled    19   substances --    20         A.     Correct.    21         Q.     -- but today we're talking    22   about opium pills.    23         A.     Understood.    24         Q.     So the controlled substances    25   are in a chain of distribution that are    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 6     Case: ^rn^-QSmt^mi^.m.#^Wi>^(^^b <%G&Mk�*c$�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1   closed off to the rest of the marketplace.    2   McKesson acknowledges that?    3                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    4                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.  It's a    5          closed system.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     And in order to participate in    8   the closed system, you have to be one of the    9   select few that gets a registration    10   certificate from the DEA, agreed?    11         A.     Agreed.    12         Q.     And the reason Congress did    13   this was to reduce diversion.  Does McKesson    14   acknowledge that?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  Yes, I believe    17          that was the overall intent.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     So it's creating rules to    20   prevent diversion to the best of their    21   ability.  McKesson acknowledges that fact?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    23                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Because if McKesson doesn't    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 7     Case: fr&jmtyQ^ffm&&&#^Wt?fefitte$o<%G&Mk�%$�?2a8?@m$t�$&fo.ew    1      follow  the   law,   then  diversion   is   likely.    2      You agree  with  that   statement?    3                                        MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    4                                        THE   WITNESS:      I   don't   know   if    5                I'd  say   --   always  characterize   it  as    6                likely  all   the   time,   but   diversion  can    7         happen.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     Okay.  Well, in this specific    10   provision, the United States Congress passed    11   a law to close the system of distribution and    12   enact laws to reduce the widespread diversion    13   of these drugs.  You agree with that?  That's    14   the purpose of this law?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     So the idea here is that --to    19   close the system of distribution so that we    20   keep these dangerous opium pills inside the    21   legitimate market for medical care, agreed?    22         a.     Agreed.    23          Q.     And that's why we have these    24   laws enacted, so that we can do our best to    25   keep these drugs to the patients that need    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 5 8     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^WiJfefitte$o0?(^^#Q^i^?der^�Sft^f^lew    1   them, agreed?    2   A.     Agreed.    3   Q.     And if you don't follow those    4   laws, then what happens is we have diversion    5   into the illicit market?    6   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7   THE WITNESS:  That can happen    8   if you don't follow those laws.    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10   Q.     And that's the reason Congress    11   created the laws as stated in this finding?    12   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13   THE WITNESS:  Correct.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15   Q.     Next I'm going to have you flip    16   to page 11.  And I just highlighted one    17   sentence in here.  And it says, ""The price    18   for participation in this traffic,"" which is    19   illicit drug trafficking, ""should be    20   prohibitive.""    21   Do you see that sentence?    22   A.     I see that.    23   Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that?    24   MS.

FARRELL:    7         Q.     It just makes sense, right?  If    8   you're going to punish somebody and the    9   punishment isn't very severe, they're likely    10   to what?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12                 THE WITNESS:  To do it again.    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14         Q.     Why?    15         A.     There's no penalty or    16   accountability.    17         Q.     And so by making the penalty    18   prohibitive, what does it do?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Could you ask the    21         question in a -- again?  What --    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     if you make the penalty    24   prohibitive, then what happens?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

HENN:  And just to note for    5          everyone's knowledge, many of you know    6          this, but in the deposition protocol,    7         one defendant's objection counts for    8          all defendants, so there's no need to    9         do depositions {sic} if I'm done them.    10         But if on the phone you can't hear me,    11          I can try to speak up.    12                 MR.

Yeah, could you put it in    22   simpler terms in --    23          Q.     Yeah.  Let me put it --    24         a.     Just so I know.    25         Q.     --in other terms.

HENN:  Objection to form.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.            What would happen?    8         A.            It wouldn't hold the same    9   weight or it wouldn't -- it may not deter    10   people from speeding.    11         Q.            What if the speeding ticket was    12   a million dollars?  What would that do?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I'm just    15         guessing, but likely people would not    16          speed.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.            Because the penalty would be    19   prohibitive, agreed? 2 0                     a.     Agreed.    21         Q.            Like not to be cute, but    22   McKesson was fined $13 million in 2008 and    23   then was fined again in 2017 $150 million.    24                 Do you think that the second    25   fine was intended to be more prohibitive than    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 62     Case: ^tn^^S^^^^m.#^Wi^^^b ^G&Mk�/k$�?2a8?@m$t��&iew    1   the first fine?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  I believe so.    4   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    5         Q.     All right.  Now, let's go to    6   Bates stamp page 26.    7                 And it says, ""Titles 2 and 3 of    8   the bill deal with law enforcement aspect of    9   drug abuse and provide authority for the    10   Department of Justice to keep track of all    11   drugs subject to abuse, manufactured or    12   distributed in the United States, in order to    13   prevent diversion of these drugs from    14   legitimate channels of commerce.""    15                 Does McKesson acknowledge the    16   truth of that statement?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     This is just another reflection    21   of the US Code that we were reading that    22   Congress is giving the authority to the    23   Department of Justice to enact safety rules    24   in order to prevent the diversion of    25   controlled substances, including opium pills,    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 63     Case: fr&jmtyQ2�&$m&&&#^Wt?fefitte$o^G&Mk�5&�?2a8?@m$t�mPiew    1     from legitimate  channels   into   illegitimate    2   channels.    3                 Does McKesson acknowledge that?    4                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    5                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     Flip to page 27, the very next    8   page.    9                 It says, ""The legislation    10   provides that all persons engaged in a    11   legitimate distribution chain involving drugs    12   included in one of the schedules under the    13   bill must be registered with the Attorney    14   General.""    15                 So again, this is bringing full    16   circle the authority of the Attorney General    17   and the Department of Justice to promulgate    18   rules for those that wish to engage in the    19   closed system of distribution for controlled    20   substances, and McKesson acknowledges that?    21                 MS.

Does McKesson acknowledge the    9   truth of that statement?    10         a.     Yes.    11         Q.     So if somebody in the chain of    12   distribution breaks the law, it has a    13   substantial detrimental effect on the public    14   health and general welfare, agreed?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  It can.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     Now go to page 44.    19                 Again, this is another    20   reiteration that Congress authorizes the    21   Attorney General to ""promulgate rules and    22   regulations and to charge reasonable fees    23   relating to the registration and control of    24   the manufacture, distribution and dispensing    25   of substances covered by the Act.""

Now flip to page 45, the very    8   next one.  This is a little bit longer, so    9   I'm going to give you a chance to read it    10   real quick.    11         A.     Okay.  I've read it.    12         Q.     So I'm going to read it aloud,    13   and I'm going to stop and ask you some    14   questions.    15                 It's -- Section B of    16   Section 303 states that the Attorney General,    17   when issuing registrations, is going to    18   consider several factors, agreed?    19         A.     Can you say that again?  I was    20   looking at --    21         Q.     Yeah, I was trying to summarize    22   the first four lines.    23         a.     Yeah.    24         Q.     Basically, what it really boils    25   down to is this is a reiteration of the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 66     Case: fr&jmty <&�G#m&&&#^Wt?fefitte$o <%G&Mk�*&�?2a8?@m$t�m?iew    1       findings  behind  the   statute   that   I   showed you    2       regarding  maintaining  effective   control.    3                                   So   if  you  drop  down  to  where   it    4       says  number  1   at  the bottom of   the  page   --    5       can you  start   reading  there?    6                       A.            Yeah.     Okay.    7          Q.     Will you read that aloud,    8   please, starting with ""maintenance of    9   effective controls""?    10          a.     ""Maintenance of effective    11   controls against diversion of particular    12   controlled substances into other than    13   legitimate medical, scientific and industrial    14   channels.""    15          Q.     All right.  So again, what    16   we're talking about is the enactment of rules    17   to prevent diversion?    18          A.     Correct.    19          Q.     Last factor, factor 5, would 2 0       you read that?    21          A.     ""Such other factors as may be    22   relevant to and consistent with the public    23   health and safety.""    24          Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that    25   Congress gave the Department of Justice the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 67     Case: fr&jmty Q^fm&&m.*-1W�>^�i\e�o O^^^j??rderi^f?aHrt^�^ew    1   authority to promulgate rules which govern    2   McKesson so that they maintain effective    3   controls against diversion, and to adopt any    4   other rule they want that may be relevant and    5   consistent with public health and safety?    6                 MS.

I just want to make sure that    10   we start off with the premise that the rules    11   we're about to go through aren't designed    12   to -- let me ask it in a better way.    13                 The rules that we're about to    14   get into, McKesson acknowledges, are designed    15   with the primary purpose of preventing    16   diversion?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     Because diversion impacts    21   public health and safety, and McKesson    22   acknowledges that?    23         a.     Yes.    24                                        MS.

The next exhibit we'll have is    4   marked as Exhibit 7, and correspondingly in    5   the top right-hand corner it's MCK    6   30(b)(6)_07-01, and it's just one page.    7                 Once we get through this    8   section, we can take a break if you like.    9                 All right.  So what I'm going    10   to represent to you is that you will not find    11   this anywhere on the Internet either because    12   I made it.  In the top left-hand corner is    13   the Department of Justice seal, and in the    14   top right-hand corner is the Drug Enforcement    15   Administration seal, and in the middle is    16   where you can trace down the rules that    17   govern McKesson.    18                 Does McKesson acknowledge that    19   Title 21 CFR 1301.74 governs its conduct with    20   the distribution of controlled substances,    21   including opium pills?    22                 MS.

Part B is what we're going to    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 6 9     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o^G&MkJl<$�?2a8?@m$t�mfc.ew    1   spend the   rest of the day on.     2         Have you read part B before?    3   A.

FARRELL:    6         Q.     And so bringing full circle, we    7   understand that the purpose of this    8   regulation, one of them, is the prevention of    9   diversion, correct?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  Correct.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     So if you engage in illegal    14   conduct and violate paragraph B, the result    15   of that is diversion?    16                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     It's the whole reason this law    19   was enacted?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge that?    23         a.     Could you ask the specific    24   question again?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

Yeah, it got very complicated    3   because it was a compound question with    4   compound objections.    5                 Does McKesson acknowledge that    6   paragraph B that we're looking at here is    7   intended to prevent diversion?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    10   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    11         Q.     And that if you follow --if    12   McKesson abides by paragraph B, its conduct    13   is legal and diversion is prevented?    14                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    15                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     And if McKesson does not abide    18   by paragraph B, its conduct is illegal and    19   the result could be diversion?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  Agree.  The    22          result could be diversion.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Well, if McKesson is    25   distributing orders of unusual size, could it    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 72     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o 0?(^^^i#2der^�iftft^S^ew    1   be anything other than diversion?    2                 MS.

HENN:  Objection to form.    8                 THE WITNESS:  Maybe the best --    9         a customer adds, you know -- their    10         business model changes or they add --    11          for example, a pharmacy may add    12          contracts with multiple long-term care    13          facilities and require that they now    14          dispense more for legitimate reasons,    15          so they could order more in that    16          context.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     So what's the purpose of the    19   Department of Justice making McKesson follow 2 0       paragraph B?    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22                 THE WITNESS:  Say that again?    23                 What's the purpose of why we    24          follow that?

I forgot to warn you before the    6   break, but during the break, did you have any    7   meaningful conversations with your counsel    8   about your testimony?    9                 MS.

HENN:  And I'm just going    18          to instruct the witness not to divulge    19         what we talked about.  I don't think    20          that's an appropriate question.  I    21          think you got the answer you were    22          looking for.    23                 MR.

HENN:  And I'll instruct    6          the witness not to divulge particulars    7         of what we talked about.    8                 But you may answer that    9         question yes or no.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR.

HENN:  I'm going to    14          instruct the witness not to answer    15          that question as calling for    16         privileged information.    17                 MR. FARRELL:  Right.  But the    18          deposition protocol and the rules    19         governing this litigation state that    20          counsel is not allowed to discuss with    21          the witness the substance of any    22          testimony during a break.    23                 And so his answer in the    24          affirmative indicates that that    25         occurred, and so I should be allowed    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 8 0     Case: fr�\3m$-cmtM&&m*-1Wb^�i\e�o ^{&&&�2<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1          to inquire about that.    2                 MS.

Well,    3          let's take a break, and we will    4          discuss outside and have a privileged    5          conversation, and we'll see if there's    6          any answer that he can provide without    7         divulging privileged information that    8          I don't believe you're entitled to.    9                 MR.

HENN:  No, Counsel, that's    14         not what's going to happen.  But I'd    15          like to take a break so that I can    16          talk to my witness about answering the    17         question inquiring into discussions    18         with counsel.    19                 MR.

And back then there    6   was a big debate on whether or not this was    7   something the federal government can do or    8   it's something that should be left to the    9   states.    10                 So what the federal government    11   decided to do was pass the Harrison Narcotic    12   Act.  What that did was it basically taxed    13   opium as a way for the federal government to    14   control, and this is a debate about the    15   taxation on the importation of opium.    16         A.     Okay.    17         Q.     Page 72 is the beginning of the    18   testimony of Mr. McKesson from McKesson &    19   Robbins, which is the predecessor and when    20   McKesson Corporation was in the private hands    21   of the McKesson family.    22                 You acknowledge that?    23         A.     Correct.    24         Q.     I'm going to have you flip to    25   page 75.  And if you look near the top, one    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 8 8     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o ^(SS&S^QSli??rder^saHfty2^5iew    1   of congressmen asks Mr. McKesson about     2   whether or not he supports this bill.  And     3   I'm going to give you an opportunity to read     4   to yourself   the provision before I ask you to    5   read it aloud.     6   A.   Which specific part do you want    7   me to start   and end at?    8   Q.   The first time it says    9   ""Mr. McKesson.""     10   A.   Okay.    11   Q.   He's asked about whether or not    12   he's in favor of the bill.     13      Do you see that?    14   A.   I do.    15   Q.   And his answer is, ""Yes, very    16   much in favor of the bill.""     17      Do you see that provision?    18   A.   I do.    19   Q.   Now, would you please begin    20   reading the   next sentence?    21   A.   Out loud?    22   Q.   Please.    23   A.   ""Our firm was founded in 1832,    24   and we have   been ever since against the sale    25   of habit-forming drugs and all that kind of     Golkow Litigation Services    Page 8 9     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o ^{&&&$l<$�?2a8?@m$t�mfc.ew    1       thing.

So you agree  with me  that   even    6       before  the  enactment  of  the  Controlled    7       Substances  Act  and  the  Code  of   Federal    8       Regulations,   which we  discussed earlier  this    9       morning,   is  that  McKesson,   Mr.   McKesson    10       hisself,   was  acknowledging  that   if   they have    11       suspicious  people,   they're  going  to  turn   it    12       over  to   law  enforcement   for prosecution,    13   agreed?    14                 MS.

And this duty predates the US    19   Code and predates the Code of Federal    20   Regulations, agreed?    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     So would you agree, would    25   McKesson agree, that it owes a common law    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 9 0     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o^G&Mk$2<$�?2a8?@m$t�m7iew    1   duty to the American public to prevent    2   diversion if it's engaged in the distribution    3   of controlled substances, including opium    4   pills, to prevent their diversion into the    5   illicit market?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask it in    8          a shorter version there?    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Probably not.    11                 Does McKesson acknowledge it    12   owes a common law duty to the American public    13   to prevent the diversion of controlled    14   substances, including opium pills, into the    15   illicit market?    16                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    17                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     Now, the first part of the    20   sentence, it kind of grabbed my attention.    21   It says, ""McKesson has ever since been    22   against the sale of habit-forming drugs.""    23   And this was in 1910.    24                 Do you see that?    25         a.     I see that.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 91     Case: k&j^<^4m&&Q&#^W^&te$o ^{&&&$3&�?2a8?@m$t�m&.ew    1         Q.

FARRELL:    6         Q.     At some point in time    7   McKesson's philosophy changed, and it went    8   from not selling habit-forming drugs to now    9   selling habit-forming drugs, agreed?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     Has McKesson considered, given    14   the presence of the opioid epidemic in    15   America, perhaps returning to the stance of    16   1910 of its founder, Mr. McKesson?    17                 MS.

FARRELL:    22         Q.     Well, you could choose not to    23   sell opium pills anymore in America, could    24   you not?    25         a.     You could choose to.

But McKesson chooses to    2   continue to sell opium pills in America,    3   despite the fact that we have an opiate pill    4   epidemic?    5                 MS.

In the top    12   right-hand corner, this is 1996, 04, 01.    13                 We've acknowledged that in    14   1971, Department of Justice adopted CFR    15   provision 1301.74, agreed?    16         a.     Agree.    17         Q.     And then we went through and    18   it's the law today, agreed?    19         a.     Agreed.    20         Q.     It's the law that was    21   referenced in the Masters Pharmaceutical    22   case, agreed?    23         a.     Agreed.    24         Q.

This is a specific year.    6   Can you tell me what year it    7   is?    8   A.     1996.    9   Q.     Why do you think I picked this    10   year?    11   MS.

What happened in 1996 that    16   changed the face of opioid sales in America?    17   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18   THE WITNESS:  I'm not    19   100 percent sure.

In 1996, I'll represent to you,    13   OxyContin   was launched.  So all I'm trying to    14   establish   on page 2 of the exhibit is that    15   under 1301.74 B, the same law was in place     16   when OxyContin was launched.     17      MS.

So you don't have any basis in    12   fact, as the McKesson designee today, to    13   discuss what the policies and procedures were    14   for McKesson related to the distribution of    15   controlled substances and opium pills between    16    '96 when OxyContin was launched and the    17   adoption of Section 55, Exhibit 12, in July    18   of 2000; is that a fair statement?    19                 MS.

It's the drug operation manual.    4   It's been -- but it's known as Section 55,    5   often within McKesson, which is also in the    6   title.    7   Q.     And as of July 2000, is there    8   any other document related to the    9   distribution of controlled substances in the    10   prevention of diversion other than    11   Section 55?    12   MS.

If you're a referee, how many    5   different books do you have to read to know    6   the rules of wrestling on the mat?    7         A.     Should be one.    8         Q.     Is that the same for this    9   document, Exhibit 12?

That's the purpose of this    10   document?    11   A.     Right.    12   Q.     Who wrote this document?    13   A.     I'm not 100 percent sure    14   exactly who wrote it within the McKesson    15   team, but a combination of people.    16   Q.     Whose document is this?    17   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18   THE WITNESS:  McKesson's.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20   Q.

Well, not as of July 2000.    9         A.     Oh, can you say it again?    10         Q.     Yeah.  This document, sitting    11   here today --    12         A.     Right.    13          Q.     --is this a document that as    14   of July of the year 2 000 was a document    15   created by McKesson in the course of    16   conducting its regular business activities?    17                 MS.

So if I hold this document up    21   in a courtroom I can say this is McKesson's    22   drug operations manual related to the    23   distribution of controlled substances that    24   was adopted in July of 2000?    25         a.

Now, the second sentence,    2   starting with ""The Drug Enforcement    3   Administration,"" can you read that sentence    4   aloud?    5         A.     Sure.    6                 ""The Drug Enforcement    7   Administration strictly interprets the law    8   and regulations and has imposed significant    9   fines for technical errors in completing    10   forms and keeping records.""    11         Q.     So the DEA, even as of July    12   2000, took the Controlled Substances Act very    13   seriously, and McKesson acknowledges that,    14   agreed?    15                 MS.

""It's extremely important that    22   McKesson employees comply fully with the    23   regulations and the following guidelines.""    24         Q.

""All compliance training    11   sessions, formal and informal, held in your    12   distribution center must be logged and    13   documented on the DEA continuing education    14   report.""    15   Q.

I don't believe I have, no.    4   Q.   But if we ask for it, it's    5   something   McKesson could theoretically go and    6   look for?       7      MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8   Outside the scope.     9      THE WITNESS:  Theoretically.    10   QUESTIONS   BY MR. FARRELL:    11   Q.   All right.  Because the policy    12   seems to d   .ndicate you guys have this    13   documentat   .ion of compliance training    14   sessions.   And I'll admit to you I haven't    15   seen any,   so I was wondering if you'd seen    16   any.       17   A.   I have not.    18   Q.   Now, if you flip to the next    19   page, page   ; 28, at the top it's paragraph A.    20   And will you read the title of paragraph A?     21   A.   ""Detecting suspicious orders.""    22   Q.

And then under    3   paragraph   1, you see where it says, ""DEA    4   regulation defines suspicious orders as     5   follows""?       6   A.   I do.    7   Q.   Will you read what's in the    8   quotation   marks?    9   A.   ""Suspicious orders include    10   orders of   unusual size, orders deviating    11   substantially from a normal pattern and     12   orders of   unusual frequency.""    13   Q.   Now, if you go down to the    14   paragraph   that starts ""recent cases,"" do you    15   see that?       16      Will you read the first    17   sentence?       18   A.   ""Recent cases indicate that DEA    19   will seek   large penalties from distributors    20   who fail to comply with this regulation.""     21   Q.

I don't -- I    5         don't have the context of before --    6          everything before, but it's a large    7          increase.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     Well, assuming in 1996 there    10   were 300,000 prescriptions and five years    11   later there were 6 million, would you --    12   would you characterize that increase as    13   unusual?    14                 MS.

Now, two paragraphs down it    5   says, ""In its testimony today"" --    6                 Do you see that paragraph?    7         A.     I do.    8         Q.     -- ""Purdue Pharma will argue    9   that the death figures heralded by newspapers    10   nationwide are inaccurate and are the prime    11   mover of the negative hype surrounding    12   OxyContin.""    13                 Do you see that sentence?    14         A.     I do see that sentence.    15         Q.     So does McKesson acknowledge    16   that death figures are being heralded by    17   newspapers nationwide as of 2001?    18                 MS.

FARRELL:    23          Q.     Yeah.    24                 This is saying that there's    25   newspaper headlines across the country of    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 13 8     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^eh*%%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1   people dying taking opium pills that McKesson    2   is distributing.    3                 Does McKesson acknowledge that?    4                 MS.

FARRELL:    10         Q.     In 2001?    11         A.     I don't know of any    12   specifically.  I'm assuming there were in    13   that time frame.    14         Q.     And it's a little unfair to ask    15   you because you weren't there in 2001, but as    16   McKesson's corporate designee I'm simply    17   looking for an acknowledgement that the chain    18   of distribution McKesson was involved in is    19   being heralded in newspapers as causing    20   deaths across the country.    21                 MS.

FARRELL:    7         Q.     I'm not asking you if you were    8   called out as a distributor.  What I'm asking    9   you is if McKesson acknowledged that the    10   pills that it was selling was causing deaths    11   nationwide and resulted in newspaper    12   headlines across the country.    13                 MS.

This is a report generated by    19   the OIG in 2002, and what it was talking    20   about was it was talking about the opioid    21   epidemic, and it was talking about the DEA's    22   ability to regulate the industry.    2 3                                     Have you reviewed this document    24       before today?    2 5        a.

Give me a second here.    2                 On Bates stamp page 12, it's    3   talking about diversion investigators.  And    4   it says there were 55 at headquarters and 455    5   in the domestic field offices and 13    6   overseas.    7                 Do you see that?    8         A.     I do see that.    9         Q.     So that means there's just over    10   500 DEA diversion investigators in the    11   country in 2001.    12                 MS.

The OIG report basically says    3   that as of 2001 there needed to be    4   reassessment because the DEA was understaffed    5   and underfunded and didn't have sufficient    6   tools to be able to regulate the industry.    7                 Does McKesson acknowledge and    8   agree with that assessment?    9                 MS.

But does McKesson acknowledge    18   that in 2001 there were 500 DEA diversion    19   investigators trying to monitor all of the    20   transactions in the country?    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22         Outside the scope.    23                 THE WITNESS:  I see that in the    24          documents.  I can't speak to, you    25         know, the DEA's total -- their    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 144     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^eh*%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Zte.ew    1          response in total, so I can confirm    2          that's in -- what's in this document.    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4         Q.     All right.  So let's talk about    5   it from a theoretical standpoint.    6                 Let's say there were 500    7   highway patrol officers charged with    8   regulating the speed on the highways in the    9   United States of America in the year 2001.    10                 Do you believe that that would    11   be a significant challenge, a somewhat of a    12   challenge or not very challengeable at all?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14         Outside the scope.    15                 THE WITNESS:  Again, just    16          speculating, it would be a challenge.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     How many people would speed in    19   America if there were only 500 highway    20   patrolmen in the country?    21                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.    22                 THE WITNESS:  I can't even    23          guess or speculate.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Do you think that would be a    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 14 5     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^eh*^%tel%&ml$ft$2&ZW.ew    1       lot  of  people  or not  a  lot  of  people?    2                                     MS.   HENN:      Same  objections.    3                                     THE   WITNESS:      Again,    that    4                     depends   on  how many  law-abiding    5                     citizens  you  have.      I   don't   know   if   I    6                     can  speculate.    7        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    8                     Q.           That   is   so  true.    9                 What do you think the American    10   citizen would do if they knew there were only    11   500 highway patrolmen?    12                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13          Outside the scope.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Again, I don't    15         know.  Some people might speed.  Some    16         people might not change their behavior    17         at all.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     That's right.    20                 What if the penalty, if you did    21   get caught, was only $10?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to scope.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR.

It really    6          depends.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8         Q.     What if the biggest weapon the    9   highway patrolmen had, which is the    10   revocation of the driver's license, was    11   changed and so now you don't even lose your    12   license?  How would that impact the system?    13                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Impact the    15          system?    16   QUESTIONS BY MR.

So if there's -- if there's a    7   limited number of regulators and a fine is    8   not substantial and you don't lose your    9   license, are we going to have more speeders    10   or less speeders?    11                 MS.

If there's not enough law    21   enforcement and the penalty isn't    22   prohibitive, what happens to conduct?    23                 MS.

What   if  you made  billion  of    5       dollars  by  speeding,   and there  was  not   enough    6       regulation by  law  enforcement  and  the  penalty    7       was  not  very big?     What  would  that  do  as  an    8   incentive?    9                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Again, it depends    11         on the situation, the scenario.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     it really depends on whether or    14   not the individual is a law-abiding citizen    15   or a criminal, agreed?    16                 MS.

I'm going to have marked    2   Exhibit 15, and the exhibit in the top    3   right-hand corner is 2004_ 06_17.  And for    4   those of you playing at home, this is an    5   excerpt from another Congressional record.    6                 This Congressional record was    7   900 pages long, and so I did not copy the    8   whole thing; I just pulled out the part that    9   interested me.    10                 This is part of the US Senate    11   Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, and    12   it was a hearing in June of 2004.  And the    13   title of the hearing was ""Buyers Beware:  The    14   Dangers of Purchasing Pharmaceuticals Over    15   the Internet.""    16                 Now, McKesson has some    17   experience with this, agreed?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19                 THE WITNESS:  Can you define --    20          experience.  What type of experience?    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     Well, McKesson was selling to    23   Internet pharmacies in this time frame,    24   agreed?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 0     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z$lew    1                 THE WITNESS:  I believe so.    2   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    3          Q.     Well, McKesson should know so    4   because you paid a $13 million fine to the    5   DEA for doing that very thing in 2008.    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Understood.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     Okay.  So this is a report, and    10   it was -- if you flip to page 2, it was    11   generated by a company called the    12   Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers of    13   America.  I guess they call it PhRMA.    14                 Is that how you say it?    15         A.     I don't know.    16         Q.     Well, McKesson is a member of    17   this organization, and so colloquially within    18   your ranks do you call it PhRMA?  PhRMA?    19   PhRMA?  What do you say?    20                 MS. HENN:  Counsel, I'm sorry,    21          just a quick clarification.  I'm not    22          seeing a reference -- I see reference    23          to Giuliani and his organization, but    24          i don't see PhRMA.    25                 Can you just point out where    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 151     Case: %i?$)fyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%<&�&$ft$2&ZW.ew    1   you're seeing that?    2   MR. FARRELL:  Yeah, it's up on    3   the screen there, and it's in the very    4   middle.    5   MS. HENN:  Thank you.  I    6   appreciate that.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8   Q.     So does McKesson -- first, does    9   McKesson acknowledge that it is an associate    10   member of the Pharmaceutical Research and    11   Manufacturers of America?    12   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13   Outside the scope.    14   THE WITNESS:  I can't speak to    15   that.  I don't know.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17   Q.     I'll represent to you -- I'll    18   represent to you that you are.    19   A.     Okay.    20   Q.     And do you know who this Rudy    21   Giuliani fellow is?    22   A.     I do know who Mr. Giuliani is.    23   Q.     He's a lawyer, too, isn't he?    24   A.     He is.    25   Q.     And he was hired to do this    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 152     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%tel%&ml$ft$2&ZW.ew    1   investigation by the pharmaceutical industry.    2                 Do you see that?    3                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    4         Outside the scope.    5                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know if I    6          see where specifically it states that.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8         Q.     It says, ""Giuliani Partners has    9   been"" --    10         A.     Oh, in the middle.  Okay.    11   Sorry.    12         Q.     They have been retained by    13   PhRMA to do an evaluation.    14         A.     Understood.  I see that.    15         Q.     Now what I'm going to have you    16   do is I'm going to have you flip over to    17   page 4, and it's interesting what Rudy    18   Giuliani found.    19                 Do you see where it says ""the    20   distribution chain""?    21                 It says, ""On its face, it    22   appears that the distribution chain for    23   prescription medicines in the United States    24   is fairly straightforward.""    25         A.     I was on the wrong number 4.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 3     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%<&�&$ft$2&Zyiew    1      I see where it says that.    2   Q.   And it says, ""Manufacturers    3   sell their products to wholesalers.""     4      That'd be you, McKesson,    5   correct?       6   A.   Correct.    7   Q.   ""Who, in turn, sell the    8   products   to retail pharmacies and stores,    9   who, in turn, dispense medicines to patients     10   with prescriptions.""     11      Do you see that?    12   A.   Yes.    13   Q.   And that's a straightforward    14   system is   what Rudy Giuliani is saying.    15      Will you read the next    16   sentence,   please?    17   A.   ""It is not until the system is    18   studied in greater detail that one begins to     19   appreciate both the complexities and the     20   vulnerabi   lity of the distribution chain and    21   potential   for exploitation or abuse.""    22   Q.   So big pharma is acknowledging    23   in 2004,   through hiring their own expert in    24   presenting to Congress, that this chain of     25   distribut   ion that McKesson is engaged in is    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 154     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z51ew    1       complex  and vulnerable   for  exploitation  or    2       abuse,   agreed?    3                                        MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    4                    Outside  the   scope.    5                                        THE   WITNESS:      It's   what   they    6                    listed  in here  and documented,   yes.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8         Q.     And the very first factor for    9   contributing factors, will you read aloud    10   what it says?    11         A.     ""Wholesalers or distributors    12   are primarily regulated by the states, with    13   no uniform standards across state borders.    14   States have a comparatively small number of    15   investigators to monitor the licensed    16   wholesalers; thus, given the sheer number of    17   wholesalers, oversight is minimal.""    18         Q.     in the very next paragraph it    19   says, ""There are thousands of secondary    20   pharmaceutical wholesalers in addition to    21   McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal    22   Health, the big three.""    23                 Do you see that sentence?    24         a.     I see that.    25         Q.     So this is a recognition by big    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 5     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e^%tel%&ml$ft$2&Zft.ew    1   pharma's own consultant that the chain of     2   distribution, at   least in 2004 with respect    3   to rogue Internet pharmacies in particular,     4   was subject to exploitation or abuse.     5   MS.   HENN:  Objection to form.    6   Outside the scope.     7   QUESTIONS BY MR.   FARRELL:    8   Q.     Agreed that's what it says?     9   MS.   HENN:  Same objections.    10   THE   WITNESS:  Agree that's what    11   it says.       12   QUESTIONS BY MR.   FARRELL:    13   Q.     And   in fact, McKesson paid a    14   fine for some of   these exploitations and    15   abuse in 2008.       16   MS.   HENN:  Objection to form.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR.   FARRELL:    18   Q.     Agreed?     19   A.     There was a fine as part of the     20   settlement.       21   Q.     Related to this specific topic?     22   MS.   HENN:  Objection to form.    23   THE   WITNESS:  It was included    24   in the settlement.     25          Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 6     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2         Q.     So yes?    3         A.      Yes.    4         Q.     So in 2004, we've got big    5   pharma acknowledging the chain of custody for    6   wholesalers is subject to exploitation or    7   abuse because of a lack of oversight?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9         Outside the scope.    10                 THE WITNESS:  Would you say    11          that again?  Ask --    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     In 2 0 04, big pharma hired Rudy    14   Giuliani's firm to do an evaluation of the    15   chain of distribution of prescription    16   medicines, and what he found was that the    17   chain of distribution was subject to    18   exploitation or abuse because of lack of    19   oversight?    20         a.     That's what's stated in the    21   document, correct.    22         Q.     And that during this time    23   frame, McKesson paid a fine for that very    24   thing?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 7     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&*%tel%&mL$ft$2&ZVL-ew    1                 THE WITNESS:  In the 2008    2          settlement, yes.    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4         Q.     And that fine was related to    5   McKesson selling an unusual size of    6   prescription opiate pills to rogue Internet    7   pharmacies?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    10         again, one more time?  Sorry.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     Yeah.    13                 In this time frame, McKesson    14   ended up paying a fine to the DEA for selling    15   too many opium pills to rogue Internet    16   pharmacies in violation of federal law?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  To be accurate,    19          I'd have to look at the document again    20          in terms of specific language, but it    21         was part of the settlement.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     We'll get to that after lunch.    24         a.     Okay.    25         Q.     But you acknowledge that what    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 8     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1       Rudy Giuliani   said   in  2004   came  home   to  roost    2       with McKesson  when   it  paid  a   fine   in  2008?    3                                     MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    4                     Outside  the   scope.    5                                     THE   WITNESS:      I   don't   know   if   I    6                     would  characterize   it   as   coming  home    7                     to  roost,   but   they're   connected  or    8                     they're  related.    9                                     MR.   FARRELL:     Take  a break.    10                                     VIDEOGRAPHER:      The   time   is    11                     12:04   p.m.     We're  going  off   the    12          record.    13           (Off the record at 12:04 p.m.)    14                 VIDEOGRAPHER:  The time is    15          1:05 p.m.  We're back on the record.    16                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 16    17         marked for identification.)    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     I'm going to reference    20   Exhibit 16 which we've just had marked.  The    21   top right-hand corner is 2006_09_27,    22   Bates-stamped MCKMDL00478906.    23                 Do you recognize this document?    24         a.     I do.    25         Q.     what is it?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 15 9     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z&.ew    1                    A.           It's  a  letter  from DEA to    2       registrants   from Joe  Rannazzisi.    3                    Q.           Is   this   --   you might   need  help    4       with  counsel   a   little  bit   on  this.    5                                   I   don't   see where  this   letter    6       is  addressed to McKesson as  the  recipient;    7       however,   this   document  was  produced by    8       McKesson.     And   I'm  assuming  this   is   the   2006    9       Rannazzisi   letter  that  was   sent  to McKesson.    10                                   Is   that  your  understanding?    11                    A.           Yes.    12         Q.     So there's no question    13   September 27, 2006, McKesson received this    14   communication.    15                 Do you know whether or not    16   there was one document sent to McKesson or    17   there was a letter sent to each of your    18   distribution facilities?    19         A.     That, I do not know.    2 0                                     MR. FARRELL:  Okay.  Can I ask,    21          Counsel, do you know?    22                 MS. HENN:  I'm sorry, I don't.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Anyway, if in fact there is    25   another document that has a specific one,    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16 0     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z51ew    1   you'll agree with me that all of these 2006    2   letters that were sent out, they were sent    3   out to all the registrants across the    4   country?    5   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6   THE WITNESS:  Yeah, that's what    7   I believe to be the case, yeah.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9   Q.     In fact, the first sentence    10   says --    11   A.     Right.    12   Q.     -- this letter is being sent to    13   every commercial entity in the United    14   States --    15   A.

Lated amongst McKesson or it was     17   discussed    or   reviewed or analyzed?    18            MS.

FARRELL:    24      Q.      Did McKesson change its conduct    25   at   all ba,   sed   upon this correspondence?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 163     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&ZWlew    1         A.     From what I understand in    2   talking with a former McKesson employee    3   before this deposition, this was mostly a    4   confirmation or a reiteration of the    5   regulations, which McKesson knew, and    6   highlighting things that were -- you know,    7   that the team was doing.  And it was sort of    8   a validation of some of the things that they    9   had been doing, so the red flags and things    10   like that.  So not significant changes that    11   I'm aware of.    12         Q.     Have you had an opportunity to    13   review the 2006 Rannazzisi letter in    14   preparation for today's deposition?    15         a.     Yes.    16         Q.     On behalf of McKesson    17   Corporation, are you willing to affirm,    18   acknowledge and validate all of the    19   statements Mr. Rannazzisi places in his    20   September 27, 2006 correspondence?    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22         Outside the scope.    23                 THE WITNESS:  Could you be more    24          specific?  Validate every single    25          statement and...

Yeah.    3                 Paragraph C of the 3 0(b)(6)    4   notice asks for ""testimony regarding    5   McKesson's past and present interpretation,    6   compliance, agreement and/or disagreement    7   with this letter from the DEA outlining the    8   duties imposed on a distributor under federal    9   law.""    10                 So let's start with this:  Is    11   there anything in this letter that you    12   disagree with?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I don't believe    15          there's anything I would disagree    16         with.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     is this an accurate statement    19   of the law?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  I believe it is.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     So as of September 27, 2006,    24   the DEA is advising McKesson -- not advising,    25   but referencing the fact that there was a    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 165     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&^%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1   prescription drug abuse problem in the United    2   States of America.  That's in the very first    3   paragraph.    4                 Does McKesson acknowledge that?    5         A.     Yes.    6         Q.     The next sentence says, ""As    7   each of you is undoubtedly aware, the abuse,    8   nonmedical use, of controlled prescription    9   drugs is a serious and growing health problem    10   in the country.""    11                 Does McKesson agree and    12   acknowledge that fact as of 2006?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    15   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    16         Q.     The next full paragraph says,    17   ""The Controlled Substances Act was designed    18   by Congress to combat diversion by providing    19   for a closed system of drug distribution in    20   which all legitimate handlers of controlled    21   substances must obtain a DEA registration; as    22   a condition of maintaining such registration,    23   must take reasonable steps to ensure that    24   their registration is not being utilized as a    25   source of diversion.""

HENN:      Objection  to   form.    4                                        THE WITNESS:      I  agree  with    5                that.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     I'd like you to read the next    8   sentence aloud, please.    9         A.     Where it starts ""distributors    10   are""?    11         Q.     Yes.    12         A.     ""Distributors are, of course,    13   one of the key components of the distribution    14   chain.""    15         Q.     Keep going, please.    16         a.     You want me to read the whole    17   paragraph?  Okay.    18                 ""If the closed system is to    19   function properly as Congress envisioned,    20   distributors must be vigilant in deciding    21   whether a prospective customer can be trusted    22   to deliver controlled substances only for    23   lawful purposes.  The responsibility is    24   critical, as Congress has expressly declared    25   that the illegal distribution of controlled    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 167     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&*%tel%&^$ft$2&ZW.ew    1       substances  has  a  substantial  and detrimental    2       effect  on  the  health and general  welfare  of    3       the American people.""    4                    Q.           So  again,   this   is   the  DEA    5       reiterating what  we've  discussed before:    6       that   failing  to  abide  by the  Code  of  Federal    7       Regulations  has  a  substantial   and detrimental    8       effect  on  the  health and general  welfare  of    9       the American people.    10                                   Does  McKesson  agree  and    11       acknowledge with that   fact?    12                                   MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    13                                        THE   WITNESS:      Yes.    14        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    15         Q.     Go to the next page, page 2,    16   the second full paragraph.  It says,    17   ""Nonetheless, given the extent of    18   prescription drug abuse in the United States,    19   along with the potential -- along with    20   dangerous and potentially lethal consequences    21   of such abuse"" -- will you please finish that    22   sentence?    23         A.     ""Even just one distributor that    24   uses its DEA registration to facilitate    25   diversion can cause enormous harm.""    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16 8     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&Z&.ew    1         Q.     Does McKesson acknowledge and    2   accept that fact?    3                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    4                 THE WITNESS:  I agree with    5          that.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     If you go down to the third to    8   last paragraph, it says, ""In addition to    9   reporting all suspicious orders, a    10   distributor has a statutory responsibility to    11   exercise due diligence to avoid filling    12   suspicious orders that might be diverted into    13   other than legitimate medical, scientific and    14   industrial channels.""    15                 Does McKesson acknowledge and    16   accept that to be true?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     And then the last sentence of    21   the next paragraph says at the end, ""The    22   distributor should exercise due care in    23   confirming the legitimacy of all orders prior    24   to filing.""    25                 Do you see that sentence?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 16 9     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%tel%&mL$ft$2&Z&.ew    1                 Not ""filing.""  ""Prior to    2   filling.""    3         A.     I see that sentence.    4         Q.     All right.  Since I butchered    5   that sentence, will you please read the last    6   sentence that's highlighted on the screen?    7         A.     ""The distributor should    8   exercise due care in confirming the    9   legitimacy of all orders prior to filling.""    10         Q.     Now, this is in September    11   of 2006, agreed?    12         A.     Agreed.    13          Q.     And this is a clear statement    14   from the DEA; would you agree with that?    15         a.     I would agree with that.    16         Q.     McKesson's official position is    17   that when it received communications from the    18   DEA, the DEA was clear as of 2006?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20         Also beyond the scope.    21                 THE WITNESS:  The only question    22          i would have about possibility is due    23          care, what the definition of what due    24          care means.    25    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 17 0     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&^$ft$2&Z�lew    1   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2         Q.     Okay.  Fair.  Fair enough.    3                 If you flip to the next page,    4   there's a laundry list of due care.    5                 Do you agree on page 3 going    6   through this, the DEA was clear with McKesson    7   about the circumstances that might be    8   indicative of diversion?    9                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10                 THE WITNESS:  I wouldn't    11          classify these -- I wouldn't call them    12          due care.  These are to be red flags,    13          indicators.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     So in 2006, the DEA is telling    16   McKesson, you have to exercise due care prior    17   to filling an order which you deem to be    18   suspicious, agreed?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Could you ask    21          that again?  Restate that?    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     in 2006, the DEA is telling    24   McKesson, you have to exercise due care prior    25   to filling an order which you deem to be    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 171     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&ZW.ew    1   suspicious, agreed?    2         A.     That's what's in the document,    3   yes.    4         Q.     Okay.  Do you disagree with    5   that?    6         A.     That they shared that, they --    7   I don't disagree with that.    8         Q.     Yet your Section 55 policy, you    9   testified this morning, you were shipping    10   suspicious orders?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12                 THE WITNESS:  There was a    13         process by which those reports were    14          reviewed, which I would consider to be    15         part of due care in a review.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     is there a due care file for    18   each of those?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Not that I'm    21         aware of.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     So there's no documentation of    24   the due care of each suspicious order that    25   was shipped by McKesson in accordance with    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 172     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%tel%&ml$ft$2&ZW.ew    1   the July 2000 policies and procedures?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  Could you restate    4          that, please?    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     Is there any documentation of    7   the due care performed by McKesson from    8   July 2000 onward pursuant to Section 55 with    9   regard to suspicious orders that were    10   shipped?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12         Outside the scope.    13                 THE WITNESS:  I can't speak to    14          the specific documentation and how it    15         was documented those reviews that were    16          conducted of those specific reports    17          that were generated.  Could have been    18          documentation on a form.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2 0        Q.     Have you seen such    21   documentation?    22                 MS.

Well, you'll agree with me that    5   Section 55 seems to indicate that there's no    6   subjective involvement regarding the    7   reporting of suspicious orders; it was a    8   statistical fact.    9   MS.

So every single order that was    4   deemed suspicious by your monitoring program    5   should have been reported to the DEA from    6   July 2000, at least through Rannazzisi's 2006    7   letter?    8                 MS.

Right.    24         Q.     if McKesson did not report    25   suspicious orders detected following the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 17 6     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& l9�ubg?eEre*^^    1   July 2000 Section 55 policy -- let me start    2   over.

Okay.    7         Q.     --if McKesson did not report a    8   suspicious order it detected pursuant to the    9   Section 55 policy, McKesson was in violation    10   of federal law; agreed or disagree?    11                 MS.

I apologize for pausing    16         here.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     It's an important question.    19         a.     Yeah.    20         Q.     McKesson has a statutory and    21   regulatory responsibility under federal 2 2        law --    23         A.     Right.    24         Q.     --to report suspicious orders    25   to the DEA?

McKesson, in July of 2000,    3   adopted a policy that we've been referring to    4   as Section 55 --    5   A.     Correct.    6   Q.     -- to do that very thing?    7   A.     Correct.    8   Q.     That policy states that it's    9   not a subjective determination of whether to    10   report; it's a statistical fact of whether    11   you should report?    12   MS.

And whether to report it to the    18   DEA is not a subjective determination; it's    19   mandatory if you detect a suspicious order?    20   MS.

Thank    8   you for taking the time.    9         Q.     No problem.    10                 So to start off with on this    11   exhibit, you acknowledge that there was a    12   meeting with the DEA on April 5, 2007.  It's    13   from the very first paragraph.    14         a.     Yes.    15         Q.     So at this point in time, the    16   DEA had issued an order to show cause against    17   McKesson, agreed?    18         A.     Correct.    19         Q.     I've yet to see any    20   documentation of anything that predates    21   April 25, 2007, related to this    22   investigation.    23                 Have you seen such documents?    24                 MS.

When you go to page 2 under    18   Proposed Action Plan, does this indicate to    19   you that McKesson is acknowledging that they    20   need to do better to comply with federal law?    21                 MS.

I don't believe it    12          says to halt them.    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14         Q.     it does?    15         A.     In that specific language.    16         Q.     it does or does not?    17         a.     Does not.    18         Q.     Is your interpretation of    19   federal law that you're allowed to ship a    20   suspicious order without conducting due    21   diligence?    22                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Maybe this explains why    25   McKesson paid a $150 million fine.

FARRELL:    3          Q.     Let's get back to it.    4                 Masters Pharmaceutical has a    5   reporting requirement and a shipping    6   requirement.  We reviewed it this morning,    7   agreed?    8         A.     Parts of it, correct.  Agreed.    9         Q.     It's premised upon a code    10   provision.  The United States Congress passed    11   a US Code provision in 1970, agreed?    12         a.     Agreed.    13          Q.     And it passed -- the Department    14   of Justice enacted regulations which are    15   binding as federal law related to this very    16   topic, agreed?    17         a.     Agreed.    18         Q.     And if you don't follow those    19   rules, McKesson can be fined by the federal 2 0       government?    21         A.     Agreed.    22         Q.     McKesson's been fined twice    23   that I know of, once for 13 million in 2008    24   and once for 150 million in 2017, for    25   violating these very laws.

So my question to you is:  Is    6   that the shipping requirement that you have    7   to halt a suspicious order under federal law    8   until you do due diligence is and always has    9   been the law in the United States of America?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11         Outside the scope.    12                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    13          again, please?    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     The shipping requirement and    16   the reporting requirement as outlined in the    17   Masters Pharmaceutical case is and always has    18   been the law in the United States of America?    19                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20         Outside the scope.    21                 THE WITNESS:  I believe that's    22          the law.  I mean...    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Well, you're McKesson --    25                 MS.

So your answer is yes?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  Yes.    10   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    11         Q.     I don't want to -- I don't want    12   you to hesitate.    13         a.     I'm not a legal expert.    14         Q.     I'm not asking you to be a    15   legal expert.    16         A.     Right.    17         Q.     I'm asking McKesson    18   Corporation -- I know this -- to be fair, I    19   understand you are in a role with McKesson    20   being asked to step in the shoes of a    21   corporation and answer on its behalf.    22         a.     Right.    23          Q.     So I'm not trying to be rude,    24   and I know I'm pressing you.    25         A.     Right.

But  what   I'm  trying  to  do   is,    2       for  the  record,   create  McKesson's  position.    3       And  I've  asked  for McKesson  to  designate    4       someone   to  announce   its  position,   and    5       fortunately  it's  you.    6                                   So  let  me  repeat   the  question.    7       The   shipping  requirement   and  the   reporting    8       requirement   as   outlined  and  defined  in  the    9       Masters   Pharmaceutical   case   is  and always  has    10       been  the  law  in  the United  States  of America;    11       agree  or disagree?    12                                   MS.   HENN:      Object   to   the   form    13                    of  the  question.      It's  outside  the    14          scope.    15                 THE WITNESS:  I agree that    16          that's the law.    17   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    18         Q.     And if you don't follow the    19   law, that makes it unlawful?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  If you don't    22          follow a law, that would be unlawful.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     And if you don't follow the    25   shipping requirement, that's unlawful?

And if you don't follow the    6   reporting requirement, that's the law?    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8                 THE WITNESS:  Again, if you    9         don't follow the law, if you don't    10          follow the guidelines, it would be    11         unlawful.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     So when you look at paragraph 7    14   of Exhibit 17, the 2007 correspondence from    15   McKesson to the DEA, you are announcing that    16   you're going to adopt new measures,    17   additional measures, revised, amended,    18   changed, more measures, to comply with    19   federal law?    20                 MS.

Now, this letter is addressed    12   to Linden Barber.    13   Do you know who Linden Barber    14   is?    15   A.     I've heard of Linden Barber.    16   Q.     How have you heard of him?    17   A.     Just in my past experience even    18   prior to McKesson, knowing he was in DEA.    19   Q.     Do you know where he is now?    20   A.     He's at Cardinal.    21   Q.     Cardinal Health?    22   How come you-all didn't hire    23   him?    24   A.     I can't speak to that.  I don't    25   know.

I mean,    22   it's -- if it's -- it wouldn't be lawful.    23          Q.     That makes it...    24         a.     If there weren't documentation.    25   Or due diligence, excuse me.

HENN:  Objection to form.    4                 THE WITNESS:  It would be    5         unlawful.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     So it's summarizing altogether.    8   If in May of 2007 McKesson is shipping to a    9   pharmacy in Cuyahoga or Summit County,    10   Cleveland, Ohio, or Akron, Ohio, more than    11   8,000 pills of hydrocodone or more than 8,000    12   pills of oxycodone, without conducting a due    13   diligence review, then McKesson is engaging    14   in unlawful conduct according to federal law,    15   agreed?    16                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    17                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask it    18          again?  I apologize.  Let's pause    19         here.  I'm not a lawyer. 2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21         Q.     I know you're not.  And again,    22   I'm going to reiterate --    23         A.     There's discretion in how this    24   due diligence is done and documented, so I'm    25   trying to understand.

So let me see if I can say it again.    3                 If in May of 2007 McKesson    4   Corporation is shipping to a pharmacy in    5   Cuyahoga or Summit County, Cleveland, Ohio,    6   or Akron, Ohio, more than 8,000 pills of    7   oxycodone or more than 8,000 pills of    8   hydrocodone without conducting due diligence,    9   then McKesson Corporation is engaging in    10   unlawful conduct according to federal law?    11                 MS. HENN:  Object to form.    12                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know how    13          to answer that exactly.  It depends.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     Depends on what?    16                 If you ship more than 8,000    17   pills without conducting due diligence,    18   McKesson is engaging in unlawful conduct    19   according to federal law?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 Go ahead.    22                 THE WITNESS:  It can be    23          interpreted that way.  I mean, it --    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Well, the DEA certainly    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 213     Case: %i?$)fyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&%Vlew    1   interprets it that way, agreed?    2   A.     They have.    3   Q.     And McKesson has paid fines    4   based on that DEA interpretation, agreed?    5   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6   THE WITNESS:  We've paid fines.    7   Again, we're --    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9   Q.     Based on the allegations by the    10   DEA that you shipped suspicious orders    11   without conducting due diligence?    12   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13   Go ahead.    14   THE WITNESS:  Based on those    15   allegations.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17   Q.      Yes.    18   A.     Right.    19   Q.     The answer is yes?    20   A.     Yes.    21   Q.     See, a yes just gets me moving    22   faster.  Oh, this one's gonna be fun.    23   MR.

It's produced in the MDL by the    10   McKesson 1   awyers?    11   A.   Yes.    12   Q.   From the McKesson files?    13   A.   Yes.    14   Q.

So this national operations    23   conference   2007, this is a conference that is    24   just for McKesson employees.  Is that your     25   understand   ing?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 216     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%tel%&mL$ft$2&%&ew    1         A.     Yeah, they typically are.    2         Q.     It's from -- Mr. Boggs    3   testified about it previously.  So this was    4   in 2007.  Management basically gets together,    5   and Don Walker is the senior vice president    6   of distribution operations, is giving a    7   presentation on a number of topics in the    8   form of a PowerPoint slide?    9         A.     Correct.    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.      Yes?    13         A.     Correct.    14         Q.     So the title of this is    15   ""Lifestyle Drugs and Internet Pharmacies.""    16                 ""Lifestyle drugs"" is an    17   interesting choice of words.    18                 Do you know where it came from?    19         A.     It's my understanding that's    20   the language that was -- the DEA used as well    21   and had referenced.    22         Q.     Some of the files that I've    23   seen has the DEA asking McKesson where you    24   came up with the oxycodone, hydrocodone and    25   opium pills as lifestyle drugs.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 217     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^eP-*%tel%&^$ft$2&%W.ew    1                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    2                 THE WITNESS:  All I can tell    3         you is I -- what I've heard is that    4          it's the term that came from DEA.    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     On page 2, it identifies    7   several different topics:  public health    8   issue, DEA focus, McKesson involvement,    9   current status, and Lifestyle Drug Monitoring    10   Program.  So these will be our jeopardy    11   questions today.    12                 Public health issues.  Can you    13   read what the very -- on page 3, can you read    14   what the first item is?    15         A.     ""Abuse of prescription drugs    16   has risen 66  percent since 2000.""    17         Q.     So this is McKesson telling    18   McKesson employees that we're in the business    19   of selling opium pills, and abuse has risen    20   66 percent since 2000.    21                 Does that not give you,    22   Mr. McKesson Corporation, pause to think    23   about whether or not your role in the chain    24   of distribution is contributing to the abuse?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

FARRELL:    4         Q.     This is McKesson telling    5   McKesson employees that abuse of prescription    6   drugs has risen 66   percent since the year    7   2000.    8                 Does that not give you,    9   Mr. McKesson Corporation, pause to think    10   about whether or not your role in the chain    11   of distribution is contributing to such    12   abuse?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I think it's --    15          it should give everybody pause that    16          that was the trend that was going on,    17         and it's a piece of information shared    18         with leaders to inform them.  So --    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     But not everybody is selling    21   opium pills; McKesson is.    22                 MS. HENN:  Counsel, can we just    23         make sure we let the witness finish    24         his answers?    25                 MR. FARRELL:  Sure.

HENN:  Thank you.    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4         Q.     Not everyone is engaged in the    5   chain of distribution of opium pills, though?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Agree.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     So I'm asking you, McKesson    10   Corporation, whether or not you have any    11   regrets about selling so many opium pills.    12                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13          Outside the scope.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Back to your    15         question about this, I would -- sure    16          that gives you pause, I mean, to    17         understand that there's an epidemic    18          out there.  And clearly there's many    19         players involved in the flow of    20         distribution.    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     As of 2007, McKesson is    23   recognizing that opioid painkillers kill more    24   than cocaine and heroin combined, agreed?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

FARRELL:    3          Q.     And these are McKesson's words.    4                 Where is McKesson getting this    5   data from?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7         Outside the scope.    8                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know    9          specifically where they -- their    10          source of data for that particular    11          line, but information from different    12          sources.  Could be DEA, could be CDC,    13          it could be wherever.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     it says here, ""Rogue Internet    16   pharmacies distributing oxycodone,    17   hydrocodone, phentermine and alprazolam,"" yet    18   McKesson was selling to rogue Internet    19   pharmacies, true?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21         Outside the scope.    22                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    23          again, please?    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     McKesson is noting that rogue    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 221     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%tel%&ml$ft$2&%1&ew    1   Internet pharmacies are selling oxycodone and    2   hydrocodone, yet what's missing from this    3   slide is the fact that McKesson was supplying    4   the pills to the rogue Internet pharmacies.    5                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6                 THE WITNESS:  And what's your    7          specific question again?    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     What gives?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know what    12          type of response a ""what gives""    13          question is.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     Yeah.  You're noting that    16   people are dying, and part of the reason is    17   that rogue Internet pharmacies are out there.    18   Yet McKesson, during this time frame, is    19   selling to some of those very same Internet    20   pharmacies, and that's what the DEA fined you    21   for.    22                 So is this ignorance of who    23   you're selling to?  Is this repackaging,    24   reframing the issue?  Or is it just flat out    25   a misrepresentation?

The next page, page 4,    6   ""Internet pharmacies.""

""Cutting supply critical to    12   success.""    13                 What does that mean?    14         a.     I don't know.

Do you know what price    19   diversion is?    20         a.     Not specifically.    21         Q.     Was McKesson at this time    22   considering that some of the Internet    23   pharmacies were competing with McKesson for    24   business?    25                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.

FARRELL:    17         Q.     So McKesson is writing a slide    18   following a meeting with the DEA, reporting    19   to the DEA employees what the DEA's focus    20   was, and what McKesson is reporting is that    21   the DEA expects you to know your customers.    22                 is that fair?    23         a.

This    2   is the December 27, 2007 Rannazzisi letter.    3   Do you recognize this document?    4   A.     I do.    5   Q.     McKesson Corporation    6   acknowledges receipt of this communication    7   from the DEA dated December 27, 2007,    8   correct?    9   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    10   THE WITNESS:  Yes, we received    11   it.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13   Q.     This is a true and authentic    14   version of the McKesson letter?    15   A.     I believe so.    16   Q.     And you kept it in the routine    17   business of collecting records,    18   record-keeping at McKesson?    19   A.     I can't speak to where this was    20   stored and -- I don't know, but --    21   Q.     But it came from McKesson; it's    22   got your Bates stamp on it?    23   A.     I may be a little confused on    24   your question.    25   Q.

It  came us.    2         Q.     You're just acknowledging you    3   received this letter?    4         A.     Correct.    5         Q.     All right.  We can walk through    6   this entire letter, but I'm going to first    7   start broadly.    8                 Does McKesson acknowledge that    9   the facts and guidelines set forth in the    10   2007 Rannazzisi letter are true and an    11   accurate representation of the obligations    12   McKesson has under federal law?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Can you ask that    15         question again?    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     Yeah.    18                 This is the second time the DEA    19   is writing a dear registrant letter to 2 0       everybody in the country.    21         A.     Understood.    22         Q.     Basically what it's saying is,    23   you people still aren't getting it; here's    24   what your obligations are under federal law.    25                 And it includes the duty to    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 24 8     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$2&%ffi.ew    1       halt   suspicious  orders,   perform due  diligence    2       and report  when necessary  to  the  DEA,   agreed?    3                                     MS.

HENN:      Objection  to   form.    7                                     THE WITNESS:      It's  the  same    8                     information  they've   shared before,    9                     with  some  additions.    10        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    11         Q.     And it's clear, you have a duty    12   to halt suspicious orders, perform due    13   diligence and report when necessary.    14                 This is an affirmation a decade    15   preceding the shipping requirement and the    16   reporting requirement in the Masters    17   Pharmaceutical case, agreed?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19                 THE WITNESS:  You rolled a    20          couple things in there together.  Can    21         you ask me -- what's the specific    22          question?    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     This is a 2007 letter, which    25   predates the Masters Pharmaceutical case by a    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 24 9     Case: ki?fmfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%iM%&ml$ft$2&%ffi.ew    1       decade.     And  I'm asking you whether  or  not    2     you agree  that   this   letter  sets   forth  the    3      shipping  requirements   and  the   reporting    4     requirements  as  outlined  in Masters    5   Pharmaceutical.    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  I'm going to read    8          this again just so --    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Sure.    11                 The second to the last    12   paragraph is probably the most helpful.    13         a.     What's that?    14         Q.     The second to last paragraph    15   may be the most helpful.    16         A.     On the very last -- okay.    17   Before I get there --    18         Q.     it states, ""Lastly, registrants    19   that routinely report suspicious orders, yet    20   fill these orders without first determining    21   that order is not being diverted, may be    22   failing to maintain effective controls    23   against diversion.""    24                 It's what you and I have been    25   talking about for the last two hours,    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 25 0     Case: ki?fmfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$2&%$lew    1   correct?    2         A.     Correct.    3          Q.     This is an accurate statement    4   of federal law from the DEA to McKesson,    5   agreed?    6                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    7                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     This is the same thing the DC    10   Circuit Court of Appeals said in 2017,    11   agreed?    12                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    13                 THE WITNESS:  Agreed.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     I don't need to put this in    16   there.  But backing up to the last exhibit we    17   had from February of 2008, can you pull that    18   up?    19                 MS. HENN:  You talking about    20         Exhibit 21?    21                 MR. FARRELL:  Yes.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     I'm going to represent to you    24   that the way that we pull these documents up    25   on the electronic system is you can pull it    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 251     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$2&m.ew    1     up   in  a   --   basically  a  photocopy version  like    2     you're   seeing  here,   but   there's   also  a  native    3      format,   which   is   actually  the   PowerPoint.    4                       A.            Okay.    5         Q.     And so what I'm showing you on    6   the screen is the same exact document, and    7   the only reason I produced it in native    8   format is that at the very bottom of each of    9   the pages, except for the first one, there's    10   a date.    11                 MR. FARRELL:  So if you flip to    12          the next page on the screen up there,    13          Corey.    14                 MS. HENN:  Do you want to just    15         hand the copy over --    16                 MR. FARRELL:  Yeah.    17                 MS. HENN:  --if that's easier?    18                 MR. FARRELL:  I just want you    19          to affirm the date on it.    2 0                                     MS. HENN:  And do you have like    21         an identifier?  I know for these kinds    22          of native documents --    2 3                                     MR. FARRELL:  Not that I can    24          figure out.  I'm not that good.    25                 MS. HENN:  All right.

What are you asking?    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4   Q.     What the date is.    5   A.     On the front page?    6   Q.     On the color version, on page 2    7   maybe.    8   A.     Oh, on the bottom?  11/26 of    9   '07.  November 26, 2007.    10   (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 24    11   marked for identification.)    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13   Q.     Okay.  The next exhibit is    14   going to be Exhibit 24.  It's 2008_03_10.    15   It's another PowerPoint presentation at the    16   Denver sales meeting, March 10, 2008.    17   Have you seen this document    18   before?    19   A.     I do not believe I've seen this    20   one.    21   Q.     It has a bunch of redacted    22   stuff in here.    23   MR. FARRELL:  Counsel, do you    24   know if that was recorded in the    25   privilege log?

HENN:  I don't know off the    2          top of my head, but we can certainly    3          check.    4                 MR. FARRELL:  I think that's    5          the main reason.  It basically is    6          talking about your CSMP, the    7          three-level review, and the rollout    8         with a bunch of stuff redacted.  I    9          just wanted to put it in the record so    10         we can fool with it later.    11                 MS. HENN:  Is this a good --    12          the witness would like a break.    13                 MR. FARRELL:  Sure.    14                 MS.

And I'll acknowledge on page 2    3   the middle whereas clause that McKesson    4   denied doing anything wrong.    5                 Sitting here today, McKesson    6   continue to assert that it did nothing wrong    7   despite the fact that it paid a fine in 2008?    8                 MS.

Now, you weren't at McKesson,    20   but you're sitting here as McKesson, so    21   you're taking the position that's in the    22   document:  We didn't do anything wrong.    23                 But you acknowledge that at    24   least in 2008 the DEA -- it's beyond doubt    25   now what the DEA could possibly mean when    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 256     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�fafe^<k�y%^e&%$�l^^$ft�2&%ftev    1       they want  you  to   fulfill  your  obligations    2       under  federal   law,   agreed?    3                                   MS.

I'm trying to establish whether    11   or not McKesson Corporation believes as of    12   May 2, 2008, the DEA could be any clearer    13   about its expectations of McKesson    14   Corporation under the federal regulations    15   related to the distribution of opium pills.    16                 MS.

I can walk through all of the    20   various communications leading up to this,    21   but you'll agree with me there was a 2006    22   letter, a 2007 letter, there were    23   presentations, there were meetings, there was    24   a rule to show cause, there's a settlement    25   agreement, you got fined $13 million.

HENN:  Objection to form.    5         Outside the scope.    6                 THE WITNESS:  I agree that they    7         mentioned that in many -- in many ways    8          and many times.  There's still -- you    9         know, there are areas of the    10          regulation that are still unclear, and    11         DEA does not provide clear guidance on    12         what is an order of unusual size,    13          frequency and pattern.  They put that    14         back on the distributors to design our    15         own.    16                 So they're not -- they're clear    17         on that guidance, but not on how to do    18          it all the time.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    20         Q.     All right.  So it's clear in    21   2008 what they're telling the DEA -- telling    22   McKesson is that whatever you're doing, we    23   think it's not enough?    24                 MS.

And one of the things that's    4   clear is that you have a duty to halt    5   suspicious orders and perform due diligence.    6                 Is there any reasonable person    7   in the United States of America as of 2008    8   could possibly argue that it's unclear    9   whether or not you should halt a suspicious    10   order before shipping?    11                 MS.

Well, what if somebody came up    16   and said, ""We don't know whether or not we    17   have a duty to halt before shipping a    18   suspicious order,"" what you say to them as of    19   May 2, 2008, on the heels of paying    20   $13 million to the DEA?    21                 MS.

Yes.    3                 Would you be a moron if you    4   took the position out of May 2, 2008, that    5   the DEA was unclear as to whether or not you    6   could ship a suspicious order?    7                 MS.

I'm just trying    8   to take it from a very basic standpoint.    9                 Could the DEA have made it any    10   clearer that McKesson has a duty to monitor    11   and detect suspicious orders?    12                 MS.

Do you believe there's a direct   19   correlation between the more pills that get   20   sold and the more pills that get diverted?   21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.   22                 THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase   23          that question?   24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:   25         Q.      Yes.

HENN:  Objection to form.    5   THE WITNESS:  It's hard to say,    6   but you could assume that the -- you    7   know --    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9   Q.     I don't want you to assume.    10   A.     Yeah.    11   Q.     I want you to use common sense.    12   A.     Yeah.  Using common sense and    13   basic logic, you could assume the more pills    14   that are out there, the more potential for    15   diversion there could be.    16   Q.     So if I were to tell you that a    17   company sold 100 pills and 10 of them got    18   diverted, and then I come back to you and say    19   a year later, a thousand pills got sold, what    20   does common sense and logic tell you as    21   McKesson Corporation how many pills get    22   diverted?    23   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    24   THE WITNESS:  I don't think    25   it's that easy of a connection to say    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 26 8     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$2&%ffi.ew    1                that  happened.     There  could be many    2                different   reasons  why  a   thousand    3                pills   --   there may be  an  increase  of  a    4                thousand pills  with   zero  diversion.    5        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    6                Q.         That's  true.    7                 Do you expect as McKesson    8   Corporation to find in general a direct    9   correlation to volume of pills sold and    10   volume of pills diverted?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12         Outside the scope.    13                 THE WITNESS:  Depends.  I don't    14         know if there's a statistic on how    15         many pills are diverted.  Again,    16          there's reasons why you may have very    17          large volumes of pills for legitimate    18          reasons and there may be zero    19         diversion.    2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21         Q.     That's true.  Let me ask it a    22   different way.    23                 Do you believe it's foreseeable    24   that the more pills you sell, the more pills    25   get diverted?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 26 9     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&b%iM%&^$ft$2&%W.ew    1                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    2                 THE WITNESS:  I would say that    3          there -- that, you know, the volume    4          of -- the more pills you have, there    5          could be, could be more to diversion.    6          It doesn't mean that there is.  Or I    7         would foresee that just an increase in    8         volume is going to increase diversion.    9         There could be.    10   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    11         Q.     The more pills that are    12   diverted -- let me ask you a different way.    13         A.     Okay.    14         Q.     Does McKesson believe that the    15   more pills that get diverted, the more pills    16   get abused?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18         Outside the scope.    19                 THE WITNESS:  Sorry, could you    20          rephrase that one again?  Let me --    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     As McKesson Corporation, do you    23   acknowledge that the more pills that get    24   diverted, the more pills get abused?    25                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.

It    4          depends, but...    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     Are people diverting pills to    7   engage in lawful conduct?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know why    10          everybody is diverting pills every    11          single time, but generally, no.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.      Right.    14                 So in general, the more pills    15   that gets diverted, the more abuse and    16   addiction we find with prescription opium    17   pills?    18         A.     There's that possibility.    19                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 27    20         marked for identification.)    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.

They got in trouble with the    21   DEA, very similar to how McKesson got in    22   trouble with the DEA in 2008, agreed?    23                 MS.

So in -- on May 9th of 2012,    4   HDMA, the Healthcare Distribution Management    5   Association, wrote a brief to a federal court    6   here in Washington, DC, in support of    7   Cardinal Health and against the DEA.    8                 Was McKesson Corporation aware    9   of this amicus brief?    10                 MS.

It's actually referenced    14          directly in the notice.    15                 MS. HENN:  I'm not sure that's    16          the case, but we can disagree about    17          that.    18                 THE WITNESS:  I don't know for    19          100 percent certain, but I assume so. 2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21         Q.     Well, I don't want you to    22   guess.  This is relatively important. 2 3                                      Have you seen any    24   acknowledgement within McKesson Corporation    25   validating or affirming or reviewing or    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 273     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& l^MfeE^jyZ^e&bSiM^^Vft^&Vlew    1   participating in this amicus brief?    2   A.

FARRELL:    6         Q.     So should they be held    7   accountable for the societal costs that are    8   documented in this pleading and referenced as    9   huge?    10         A.     I think it depends.    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     Depends on what?    14                 MS. HENN:  Same objection.    15                 Go ahead.    16                 THE WITNESS:  It depends on the    17          facts and circumstances and, you know,    18          the information about the specific    19          situation.    2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21         Q.     If a distributor repeatedly    22   fails to report suspicious orders, do you    23   believe it should be held accountable for the    24   societal costs of prescription drug abuse?    25                 MR.

The facts and circumstances.    7         Q.     How about the facts and    8   circumstances which led to McKesson paying    9   $150 million fine?    10                 MS.

Do you think McKesson is partly    15   responsible for the societal costs of    16   prescription drug abuse in America?    17                 MS.

We'll get to the others in a    13   second.  I want to talk about McKesson first.    14                 This is your opportunity to    15   accept partial responsibility for the    16   societal costs of prescription drug abuse in    17   America; yes or no?    18                 MS.

Well, you can say yes or --    16   A.     I understand that.    17   Q.     -- you can say no.    18   A.     I understand that.    19   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    20   QUESTIONS BY MR.

It depends on the    4          role that they played.    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     Well, back to McKesson    7   Corporation, which is you sitting in the    8   chair today.  Knowing what you know as the    9   3 0(b)(6) representative, the corporate    10   designee, knowing about your past conduct,    11   knowing about the past interactions with the    12   DEA, I'm going to ask you again:  Does    13   McKesson Corporation accept partial    14   responsibility for the societal costs of    15   prescription drug abuse in America?    16                 MS.

FARRELL:    5                     Q.           Sir,   we're  not  going  to  parse    6       out  percentages.    7                        A.             Yeah.    8         Q.     Let's just talk globally for    9   McKesson Corporation.  So I don't want to put    10   words in your mouth because it's got to come    11   out of your mouth.  So the answer is yes or    12   no.    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I would say yes,    15         partially.    16   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    17         Q.     How about Purdue Pharma?  Does    18   McKesson Corporation take the position that    19   Purdue Pharma is partially responsible for    20   the societal costs of prescription drug abuse    21   in America?    22                 MS.

So, yes.    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     Flip to page 8, the last    7   paragraph.  Your trade organization is saying    8   that the ""DEA's goal, the prevention of    9   diversion of controlled prescription drugs,    10   is, of course, a public good.""    11                 Does McKesson validate,    12   acknowledge and affirm that statement?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  Absolutely.  The    15         prevention of the diversion of    16          controlled substances is good for the    17         public.    18                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 29    19         marked for identification.) 2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR.

Gary Boggs is    12   former DEA.       13   A.   PowerPoint, not spreadsheet.    14   Q.   Yeah, I'm sorry.    15   A.   Okay.    16   Q.   He's former DEA, correct?    17   A.

And as we'll see later, he was    22   actually in   the room for one of the    23   presentations when DEA was negotiating with     24   McKesson on   the 2008 settlement.    25      Is that your memory as a    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 288     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�u^^gitec[:cp^^ge29Q:8h%l%ee%a^Pdfty-2gi^ew    1   corporate entity?    2                 MS.

""Protecting America from    18   Prescription Drug Diversion.""    19                 The next page is a history of    20   understanding the problem, and on page 4 it    21   talks about a collision course.    22                 And presumably this is two    23   planes colliding in the air, and that's    24   OxyContin and Percocet.    25                 Do you see that?

Which resulted in an increase    14   or decrease in the number of pills McKesson    15   sold?    16         A.     I don't know exact numbers, but    17   it increased.    18         Q.

He's one of the leaders on the    8   regulatory affairs team.    9         Q.     Okay.  And this is his    10   statement that ""Manufacturers fueled the use    11   of prescription painkillers.""    12                 Is that McKesson's position?    13                 MS.

We'll have to ask him.    20                 But I'm asking McKesson whether    21   or not it shares this view.    22                 MS.

I think there's many    10          reasons -- many things that fueled the    11          epidemic.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.

HENN:  37.    14                 MR. FARRELL:  Oh, okay, I'm    15          sorry.  But it's okay because we'll    16          just put 36 as the administrative    17         memorandum, which is 2017_01_5C,    18         MCKMDL0355513.    19                 MS. HENN:  And, Counsel, we've 2 0        been going about an hour, so if we    21          could have a break at a good stopping    22         point.  It doesn't have to be this    23          second, but if there's one very soon,    24          that would be great.    2 5                                     MR. FARRELL:  Yeah, very soon.

Just to acknowledge, McKesson's    4   still is denying liability, and this time the    5   cost has become more prohibitive with the    6   fine, 150 million.    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     Agreed?    10         a.     Agreed.  We settled with the    11   settlement agreement, agreed.    12         Q.     McKesson's distribution    13   facilities were systematically failing to    14   report suspicious orders and resulted in a    15   $150 million fine assessed by the DEA and    16   paid by McKesson Corporation; true or not    17   true?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19                 THE WITNESS:  We did pay that    20          fine, $150 million.    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     Because you were systematically    23   not reporting suspicious orders?    24                 MS. HENN:  Same objection.    25                 THE WITNESS:  That was at the    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 3 07     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&*%iM%&^$ft$mW.ew    1          core of it.    2   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    3          Q.     So let's just be fair.  There    4   were certain distribution facilities that    5   utterly failed to fulfill their obligations    6   under federal law to monitor, detect, halt    7   and report suspicious orders, which resulted    8   in McKesson paying the largest fine in the    9   history of the DEA; true or not true?    10                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    11                 THE WITNESS:  Could you    12          simplify that question a little bit?    13   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    14         Q.     Yeah.    15                 McKesson wasn't following the    16   law and got fined $150 million?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  We acknowledged    19          that certain orders did not get    20          flagged in our system.    21   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    22         Q.     Thousands.    23                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Thousands of orders?    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 308     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$m<&ew    1   A.   Orders.    2   Q.   Like some facilities reported    3   none.       4      MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    5   QUESTIONS BY   MR. FARRELL:    6   Q.   Yes?    7   A.   Systematically none.    8   Q.   Systematically none.    9      And it wasn't just an isolated    10   distribution   facility.  It was several    11   different facilities across the spectrum at     12   McKesson had   utterly failed to comply with    13   federal regulations to prevent diversion of     14   controlled substances?     15      MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16      THE WITNESS:  We believed we    17   were in good faith working with DEA as     18   part oj   E the 2008 agreement to report    19   customers and report orders in a     20   different way that was mutually agreed     21   upon.   So --    22   QUESTIONS BY   MR. FARRELL:    23   Q.   Yeah, I'm not asking --    24   A.   -- I would say --    25      MR. FARRELL:  You're right.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 309     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%iM%&^$ft$mW.ew    1         You're right.    2                 THE WITNESS:  I know you say    3          zero, but I -- you know, there are    4          situations and scenarios where we    5          reported based on what we agreed to    6         with the DEA, based on that settlement    7         agreement.    8                 So I understand systematically    9          they weren't being reported, but they    10         were being reported in other ways.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     Sitting here today does    13   McKesson Corporation acknowledge that it    14   utterly failed in its obligations to prevent    15   diversion of opium pills into the American    16   illicit market?    17                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    18                 THE WITNESS:  No, I don't    19         believe we utterly failed.  We, again,    20          in good faith over the years have    21         worked with DEA, taken guidance,    22          developed programs, enhanced programs,    23          evolved them over the course of time.    24                 So I wouldn't characterize it    25         as utterly failing.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 310     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& l^^^^^^y^^^^^^l^^^^^^gqi^    1   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2         Q.     Well, when you report zero    3   suspicious orders over years at the same time    4   selling tens of millions of opium pills into    5   a community, you're not meeting your    6   obligations under federal law, agreed?    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8                 THE WITNESS:  Again, there's    9          certain times in which we acknowledged    10          that we did not report orders.  That    11         does not mean that we did not conduct    12          diligence, that we did not evolve our    13         program to help prevent.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    15         Q.     And I understand the desire to    16   want to say in good faith you did your best.    17   What I'm asking for is a very simple    18   acknowledgement that McKesson was not    19   following the law and got fined for it on two    20   occasions.    21                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    22                 THE WITNESS:  Those were the    23          allegations.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Do you accept those allegations    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 311     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19^^^^^^y%y^e^^^l^^^^^2^gq^e}lj    1   as partially true?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  Again, we --    4         partially, in the second agreement, we    5         did acknowledge that, you know, we    6          didn't identify all the suspicious    7         orders that we could have.    8   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    9         Q.     In fact, in some distribution    10   facilities you didn't identify any?    11                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    12   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    13          Q.     This isn't like we missed a    14   needle in a haystack.  This is we missed the    15   hay.    16                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    17                 THE WITNESS:  So the thing I    18         would just share is that, again, all    19         of those orders were blocked and not 2 0                     shipped.  And we may not have    21          systematically, as I mentioned    22          earlier, reported, but --    23                 MR. FARRELL:  Hold on.    24                 MS. HENN:  Wait, he's not done    25         with his answer.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 312     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&t%iM%&^$ft$mWlew    1                 THE WITNESS:  I'm just    2          reiterating the point I made earlier    3          about the 2 008 agreement, mutually    4          discussing with DEA the fact that we    5         were focusing on customers and would    6          report suspicious orders in a mutually    7          format --a mutually-agreed-upon    8          format.    9                 So you say zero, but it may not    10         always be zero.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12         Q.     Just to be fair with you, we're    13   going to take a break.    14         A.     All right.    15         Q.     I have the transactional data    16   in Cuyahoga and Summit County from McKesson    17   sales of opium pills.  I also have the    18   suspicious order reports.    19                 So let's be clear:  McKesson    20   didn't get in trouble for blocking orders and    21   not reporting them.  McKesson paid a record    22   fine for shipping suspicious orders and not    23   reporting them.    24                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    25                 THE WITNESS:  Say that again.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 313     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$mVlew    1                    I  want   to  be  very  clear  what   I   heard.    2   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    3          Q.      Me, too.    4         A.     Yeah.    5         Q.     You're telling me that    6   McKesson's conduct that it admitted to,    7   McKesson's position is that it blocked    8   suspicious orders and then just simply didn't    9   report them in the right way.  That's your    10   position?    11         A.     We systematically -- based on    12   the design of our system, orders were    13   blocked.    14         Q.     You believe that McKesson was    15   blocking all the suspicious orders and paid    16   $150 million because of the manner in which    17   it reported?    18         a.     Earlier I said we did    19   acknowledge that some orders, not all, we    20   didn't block.    21         Q.     Okay.  So let's get back --    22         a.     We didn't -- let me rephrase    23   that.  We acknowledge that our system may not    24   have detected orders that could be deemed as    25   suspicious.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 314     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$mW.ew    1         Q.     And that the orders that your    2   system did detect as suspicious, you still    3   shipped anyway without reporting them?    4                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    5                 THE WITNESS:  No.    6   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    7         Q.     You believe that's not true?    8         A.     Based on my understanding of    9   our systems and how things work in -- when    10   they hit a threshold and they're blocked,    11   those do not get shipped.    12         Q.     All right.  So fair --    13         a.     That's how we define those    14   suspicious orders.    15         Q.     Fair enough.    16                 Let me ask you this:  If your    17   system detects a suspicious order and you    18   ship it anyway and you don't report it, is    19   that unlawful?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  Please say that    22          again.    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     if your system detects a    25   suspicious order and you ship it anyway    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 315     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^ett%iM%&mL$ft$mW.ew    1   without reporting it, is that unlawful?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  I think it    4          depends.    5   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    6         Q.     On?    7         A.     There could be a technical    8   glitch --    9         Q.     Okay.    10         A.     -- or some computer error.  I    11   mean --    12         Q.     I'm talking about hundreds and    13   hundreds and hundreds of orders that are    14   red-flagged by McKesson and shipped anyway    15   without reporting a suspicious order.    16                 The US Attorney for the    17   Northern District of West Virginia doesn't    18   say this was a technical glitch.  He says it    19   was a systematic failure by your company to    20   abide by West Virginia law -- or federal law.    21                 You paid a record fine, and    22   you're disavowing the underlying conduct    23   today?    24                                           MS.   HENN:      Objection  to   form.    25                                            THE  WITNESS:      I'm  just   trying    Golkow  Litigation  Services    Page   316     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$mirlew    1                    to  communicate   that   our   system  that    2                    was  designed  to  detect   suspicious    3                    orders  using  the   concept   of   thresholds    4                    blocked all   of  the   --  blocked those    5                    suspicious   orders.    6                                   We  recognize  that  and    7                    acknowledge  that   it  may not  have    8                    picked up  on  all   of   the   suspicious    9                    orders  and...    10                 MR. FARRELL:  One more and    11         we'll take a quick break.    12                 MS. HENN:  If it's okay, I'd    13          like to take it now.  It's been now an    14         hour and 15 minutes.  It's pretty    15          tiring to be a witness.  So if we    16          could just take a five-minute break,    17          that would be great.    18                 MR. FARRELL:  Okay.    19                 MS.

So what I'm going to do is    20          I'm going to finish up some topics,    21         and I'm going to state for the record    22          that I have not been able to get    23          through all of the designated topics    24          today.    25                 That being said, there are some    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 318     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$m&ew    1                additional   topics  that  you were  not    2                designated  for.     There's   essentially    3                two  notices.    4                 So what we're -- what I'm going    5          to do is recommend that I finish up    6          the topics that I want to get to, and    7          then tomorrow is your fact deposition.    8         And what we'll do is work out with    9          counsel if there are any of these    10         questions that can be answered in    11         writing to avoid you having to come    12         back and testify on things that can be    13          answered.    14                 And then in addition, there are    15          records and there are -- there is    16          transactional data historically and    17          suspicious order report historically    18          that have not been disclosed yet    19         because of our tight schedules that    20          I'll -- I will be going to ask --    21          eventually to ask for some additional    22          time from you to finish the stuff we    23          didn't get to finish and to ask    24          questions about documents that have    25         not been disclosed yet.

FARRELL:    6         Q.     Jumping in real quick, I'm not    7   going to spend a whole lot of time on this; I    8   have a very specific question.    9                 Before we get into the    10   document, there's a reference in here about    11   heroin, and I just wanted to see if I could    12   cut to the chase with you.    13         A.     Okay.    14         Q.     As the McKesson corporate    15   representative, do you acknowledge that abuse    16   of prescription opium pills is a gateway to    17   the initiation of heroin?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19         Outside the scope.    20                 THE WITNESS:  Based on    21          everything that I've read and in the    22         media and statistics and discussion, I    23         would agree -- agree to that.    24        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    25                         Q.             if  you abuse  prescription    Golkow  Litigation  Services    Page   32 0     Case: %i?tfnfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&%%iM%&mL$ft$2&&lew    1   opiates, the CDC says that you're 4 0 times    2   more likely to initiate heroin use.    3   Does McKesson acknowledge    4   that -- that prescription opiate pill abuse    5   is a driving factor in the heroin epidemic    6   we're also experiencing?    7   MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8   Outside the scope.    9   THE WITNESS:  Yeah, it'S a    10   factor.    11   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    12   Q.     That was easy.    13   A.     Yeah.    14   Q.     All right.  Back to this amicus    15   business.    16   (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 38    17   marked for identification.)    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19   Q.     I'm going to mark as    20   Exhibit 38, it's 2016_04_04.  This is another    21   amicus brief.  This one is Masters    22   Pharmaceutical.    23   Does McKesson acknowledge that    24   in 2016 when this amicus brief was submitted    25   that it was still on the executive committee    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 321     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&ml$ft$mi&ew    1   of HDMA?    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3          Outside the scope.    4                 THE WITNESS:  I can't speak to    5          that.  If I saw a list of who was on    6          the executive committee...    7                 (McKesson-Hartle Exhibit 39    8         marked for identification.)    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Fair enough.  Exhibit 39,    11   2016_04_05, the Wayback Machine.    12                 So looking at the Exhibit 39,    13   can you acknowledge that McKesson was on the    14   executive board of HDMA --    15         a.     Yes.    16         Q.     --at the time that this amicus    17   brief was submitted?    18         A.     Yes.    19         Q.     Have you had a chance to review    20   the amicus brief?    21         A.     I had a chance to look at some    22   of the highlighted sections.    23          Q.     So let's go to 2016_04_04,    24   page 5.    25         a.     Page 5.    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 32 2     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%iM%&ml$ft$mW.ew    1         Q.     Down the right-hand side, you    2   can see two-thirds of the way down it starts,    3   ""DEA.""  The one below that.  Yeah.    4                 ""DEA has required distributors    5   not only to report suspicious orders but to    6   investigate orders by interrogating    7   pharmacies and physicians and take action to    8   halt suspicious orders before they are    9   filled.  Those added obligations would    10   significantly expand a report-only duty of    11   distributors under the long-standing    12   regulatory scheme and impose impractical    13   obligations on distributors.""    14                 Is that McKesson's position?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16         Outside the scope.    17                 THE WITNESS:  Obviously we're    18         part of the organization.  In parts,    19         you know, I agree with the added --    20         what it would -- you know, the added    21          responsibility or time that it would    22          take to -- you know, to investigate    23          each order.    24                 I don't know if I'm answering    25         your question, but...

You're stumbling toward it.    3         A.     Yeah.    4         Q.     Let's go to page 6, a little    5   more direct.  The second highlighted    6   provision:  ""As the final order in this case    7   underscores, however, DEA now appears to have    8   changed its position to require that    9   distributors not only report suspicious    10   orders but investigate and halt suspicious    11   orders.""    12                 This is a 2016 document by your    13   trade organization, of which McKesson sits on    14   the executive board, and its telling the DC    15   Circuit Court of Appeals that it does not    16   have a duty to investigate and halt    17   suspicious orders.    18                 Does McKesson validate this    19   position?    20                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    21                 THE WITNESS:  Can you rephrase    22          that for me?    23   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    24         Q.     Yeah.    25                 In 2016, your trade    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 324     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$2&$tt.ew    1   organization is telling the second highest    2   court in the land, the DC Circuit Court of    3   Appeals, that the DEA is now requiring them    4   to investigate and halt suspicious orders.    5                 Haven't we agreed that's been    6   the duty since 1971?    7                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    8         Outside the scope.    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Tough position to defend, isn't    11   it?    12                 MS. HENN:  Same objections.    13                 THE WITNESS:  You know, again,    14          I -- I recognize that other    15         distributors have different systems    16          and have worked with DEA over the    17         years on different methodologies,    18         whether it's a threshold to block it    19         or it's a hold and investigate and    20          then block it.  And so, you know, I    21          recognize that.    22   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    23          Q.     You recognize this position is    24   problematic given your experience, McKesson    25   Corporation, with the DEA?

FARRELL:    6         Q.      Yeah.    7                 But we're still trying to    8   figure out from internal communications    9   whether or not McKesson signed off on this    10   brief.    11                 Are you aware of whether or not    12   they signed off on this?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14                 THE WITNESS:  I don't -- I am    15         not aware of the process that goes    16          into signing off on these briefs and    17         what that specific looks like.  I know    18         how trade organizations work and how    19          they get to a point of consensus. 2 0       QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    21        Q.     Let me ask you in a different    2 2        way.    23                 We talked about the original    24   enactment of the Controlled Substances Act    25   where the penalty for engaging in unlawful    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 32 6     Case: ki?fmfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$2&$ftew    1   conduct should be prohibitive.    2                 Do you remember talking about    3   that this morning?    4         A.     I do.    5         Q.     And so in 2008, McKesson    6   Corporation paid $13 million, and in 2017,    7   McKesson paid $150 million.    8                 What would happen in today's    9   world if McKesson went to the DEA and said,    10   ""We don't have a duty to investigate and halt    11   suspicious orders""?  What do you reckon would    12   happen then?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14         Outside the scope.    15                 THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure    16          exactly what would happen, but they    17         wouldn't be thrilled.    18   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    19         Q.     So what do you think the fine    20   will be next time?    21         A.     I can't speculate what it would    22   be.  It depends on the facts and    23   circumstances and...    24         Q.     So just simply stated, sitting    25   here today, McKesson Corporation, do you    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 32 7     Case: ki?fmfyOmfc$&&i&BS& 19�MfeE^&y%^e&*%iM%&^$ft$mW.ew    1   accept or reject the position your trade    2   organization is taking regarding the    3   interpretation of the shipping requirement    4   and reporting requirement?    5                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    6         Outside the scope.    7                 THE WITNESS:  I apologize.  Can    8         you ask -- ask me again or rephrase?    9         Do we accept --    10   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    11         Q.     Yeah.    12                 The sentence you see up there    13   on the screen --    14         a.     Yeah.    15         Q.     -- submitted by your trade    16   organization to which McKesson sits as an    17   executive board member, this is a position in    18   a legal document submitted to the second    19   highest court in the United States of    20   America.    21                 Sitting here today, does    22   McKesson Corporation accept or reject this    23   position?    24                 MS.

As being part of that    9   organization.    10         Q.     So your position today is    11   McKesson does not have a duty to investigate    12   and halt suspicious orders?    13                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    14   QUESTIONS BY MR.

Basically, the position in this    12   brief is they're trying to figure out how in    13   the world that 2006 letter became a command    14   to distributors to engage in due diligence    15   and avoid filling suspicious orders.    16                 MS.

You get the gist of what I'm    8   asking you?    9         A.     Can you ask it in a different    10   way?    11         Q.     Yeah.    12                 This appears to say that    13   McKesson does not have a duty to engage in    14   due diligence, nor does it need to avoid    15   filling suspicious orders.    16                 Is that your position sitting    17   here today?    18                 MS.

HENN:  Objection to form.    3                 THE WITNESS:  I can say -- I    4          can't say that it's nonsense.  I'm not    5          sure how to answer this one    6          specifically.    7   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    8         Q.     Go to page Bates stamp 9.    9   ""Nothing in the federal regulations requires    10   distributors to investigate the legitimacy of    11   orders or to halt shipments of any orders    12   deemed to be suspicious.""    13                 Does McKesson disavow this    14   statement or agree with it?    15                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    16                 THE WITNESS:  You know, I do    17          think the language of the regulations,    18         you know, ""design and operate a system    19          to disclose suspicious orders,"" gets    20          interpreted in many different ways,    21         and that -- and that's how different    22          organizations, distributors, develop    23          their program.    24   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    25         Q.     Respectfully, that's how you    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 332     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&b%iM%&mL$ft$2&$&ew    1   get fined $150 million.    2                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    3   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    4         Q.     The next sentence:  ""There is    5   no prohibition on shipment of suspicious    6   orders.""    7                 That's wrong, isn't it?    8                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    9   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    10         Q.     Make it easier.  Let's go to    11   page 12.    12                 ""DEA's regulations had sensibly    13   imposed a duty on distributors simply to    14   report suspicious orders, but left it to DEA    15   and its agents to investigate and halt    16   suspicious orders.""    17                 Nonsense or not nonsense?    18                 MS. HENN:  Objection to form.    19   QUESTIONS BY MR. FARRELL:    2 0        Q.     Or no comment?  I'm giving you    21   an out.    22         a.     I would say no comment.  I'm    23   not sure how to answer that specifically.    24         Q.     Well, the answer should be    25   someone needs to call HDMA and figure out why    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 33 3     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$2&$�lew    1   they're taking nonsense positions, but I'll    2   leave that to somebody else.    3                 All right.  Homestretch.  Some    4   toys.  As many at this table probably know,    5   I'm the ARC0S nerd.    6                 You're familiar with ARC0S?    7         A.     I'm familiar with what it is,    8   yep.    9         Q.     I'm the guy that's been banging    10   away trying to get access to ARCOS for the    11   better part of a year and a half, and I got    12   some.    13                 Now, what this is is the    14   transactions by every distributor in the    15   country between 2006 and 2014, and it's    16   related to Cuyahoga and Summit County.  Now,    17   we also have the rest of the country, so I'm    18   able to determine national averages, state    19   averages and county averages for every    20   distributor, including McKesson.  But we're    21   not going to get into all of that today    22   because what I really need is I need the    23   transactional data dating back to 1996.  I'm    24   missing a decade.  I have '06 to 2014.    25                 Last week, July 25th, your    Golkow Litigation Services    Page 334     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^�y%^e&%%iM%&^$ft$2&&lew    1        counsel  provided a  spreadsheet   that  gave us    2         2006   to  2018.     All   right?     So  we've  had  it    3         for a week.      I  played with  it  a  little  bit.    4                                            But   I   don't  have  the  decade    5         from  the   launch  of   OxyContin  to  2006   yet,   but    6         I'm working  on   it.      So  one   day we  may  come    7        back and have  to  talk  about  this    8         transactional   data   in  a  different   context.    9                                           But  that  being  said,   one  of  the    10         interesting  things   that   I   did was   I   grabbed    11        the  data provided by your  counsel,   and  I    12        pulled  it  up  and took  a  look at   it.    13                                            MR.    FARRELL:      Corey,    can  you    14                         pull   that  up?    15        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    16         Q.     Now, the first thing I want you    17   to note is this is highly confidential.    18   Nobody in here is allowed to talk about it    19   outside this room.    20                 And it's MCKMDL00478913.    21                 MR. FARRELL:  Is that right?    22                 MS. HENN:  I see    23                         MCKMDL00478913.      That  may be   the   same.    24        QUESTIONS   BY   MR.    FARRELL:    25                         Q.             Okay.      Can  either  you  or  your    Golkow  Litigation  Services    Page   33 5     Case: kiJfmfyO�ffl��&gn&B&& 19�MfeE^jy%^e&^%iM%&ml$ft$2&$%.ew    1   counsel confirm that this is the complete    2   transactional data for McKesson in Cuyahoga    3   and Summit counties between 2006 and 2018?    4 5    9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20    ? ? ? ? ?    MS. HENN:  Object to form.    Go ahead.    THE WITNESS:  I wasn't involved in pulling it, so I can't -- without seeing, I can't confirm that it's everything.    MR. FARRELL:  Yeah, it's really a question for your counsel, but I'm not allowed to put her under oath, so I'm hoping she'll volunteer.    MS. HENN:  That's my understanding, but I'm not the person who is most knowledgeable about this, so you should ask one of my colleagues. QUESTIONS BY MR.

Because remember, there was a    10   period of time where there were 300,000    11   prescriptions of OxyContin, and then -- in    12    '96, and then by 2001 there were 6 million,    13   right?    14                 So when we get the data for the    15   first ten years, we're going to see a    16   progression of the number of pills being    17   delivered.  Okay?    18                 So one of the things that I'm    19   going to have you do is we're able to do some    20   analysis with the ARCOS data.    21                 MR. FARRELL:  So, Corey, if    22         you'll bring up Summit County PDF. 2 3                                     MS. HENN:  Do you have a    24          document that we can look at?

So you understand the position    5   about reporting suspicious customers McKesson    6   made to the United States District Attorney    7   in northern West Virginia and resulted in    8   you-all getting fined 150 million.

PagelD #: 128084    MEMORANDUM    November 2,2010    To:     Karen Harper    From: Howard Davis    Subject: Suspicious Order Monitoring Program No. C/S Comp 3.0    Reference is made to Mallinckrodt Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) C/S Comp 3,0 entitled: ""Identification and Review of Peculiar Orders"" which publishes the Peculiar Order Report for orders in excess of ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^j]    I                                                                               I. The algorithms have been    established to identify whether a customer is deviating from a normal order pattern, and/of increasing in frequency,,    The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has implemented a strict *due diligence program* to maintain effective controls and procedures to guard against theft and diversion of controlled substances (21 Code of Federal Regulations 1301.71).. It is also a Statutory public health and safety registration requirement under Title 21 United States Code (USC) 823 and a basis for revocation of a DEA registration under 21USC824, Under the due diligence program, as published in numerous Federal Register notices and related DEA correspondence to the registrant population, DEA has determined that algorithms and/or arithmetic formulas to define whether an order is suspicious may be failing to detect suspicious orders. Federal Register notices published as early as 2007 (72 Federal Register 36487) state specifically that using formulas that rely on percentages or averages over time has been determined, by the DEA, to be insufficient. The DEA registrant population, especially (but not exclusively) at the wholesale level now must be aware of and implement safeguards to guard against diversion through excessive or suspicious orders. In effect, the DEA has eliminated what was once only a few years ago a suspicious order reporting system that many viewed as absolving liability on the part of the DEA registrant if the order was filled, although suspicious, upon DEA notification,    An order must not be processed and filled if it is either suspicious or excessive. The existing SOP excels to meet this requirement through a specific evaluation process. However, the numeric formula is problematic. For example, should an occasion arise where an order is three times over the historical average for that customer and item or in a situation where the order meets but does not exceed the f''^ criteria, ft Would theoretically be filled through normal processing without further question. In doing so in certain cases and as noted in recent immediate suspensions of other large scale DEA registrants, which are all a matter of public record, Mallinckrodt would be unnecessarily exposing itself to potential liability, The fundamental basis of the immediate suspensions in question were suspicious order monitoring deficiencies.

PagelD #: 128085    Numeric formulas do not identify circumstances that might be indicative of diversion such as: ordering larger quantities of a limited variety regularly that would otherwise not be viewed as suspicious (like ordering controlled substances with few, if any, other drugs or products whether controlled or non-controlled); ordering highly abused controlled substances in limited quantities disproportionate to other products; or even ordering the same controlled substances from multiple suppliers. DEA's due diligence program requires the registrant population to ""know your customer"" as part of an effective suspicious order monitoring program to insure that these examples of representative issues are not occurring.    The DEA registrant population as a whole is now required to consider the totality of the circumstances when evaluating an order prior to it being filled, just as the DEA will do in determining if the registrant is operating within the public interest within the meaning of 21USC823 and 824, which are the statutory requirements for obtaining a DEA registration and grounds for denial, suspension or revocation. While not all inclusive, recommended customer inquiries may include such factors as:    �    What percentage of business do controlled substances constitute?    �    Is the customer complying with other federal, State, local requirements/laws?    �    Is the customer soliciting and/or supplying customers via the Internet unlawfully? � ?   Does the customer have a business relationship with a physician or other business    partner who authorizes prescriptions over the Internet?    �   . Are prescribing practitioners licenses in the State where the controlled substances    are being shipped?    �    Are shipments made where the majority of the ultimate customers are serviced from the same practitioner who routinely authorizes ""cocktail"" prescriptions, I.e., drug combinations that compound or have an antagonistic effect?    �    Are controlled substances sold to retail outlets that further dispense them without a prescription?    �    Does the customer sell controlled substances for market prices or well above state-of-the-art pricing modules?    �    Are sells made to customers, or their customers, on a cash only basis or are insurance plans accepted?    Therefore, 1 recommend the immediate revision of SOP No. C/S Comp 3.0 to include additional definitive criteria, as noted above, such that a more vigilant detennination can be made whether the order is suspicious and/or excessive prior to filling any order, in concert with numeric formulas already in place as the Company deems appropriate. Thus, the Company can assure and reference procedures that insure regulatory and statutory compliance with the public interest provisions under the Controlled Substances Act as circumstances warrant upon request. A new draft SOP entitled: ""Due Diligence Procedures and Monitoring of Controlled Substances Sales"" is included for consideration aS a replacement or to be used in addition to the current SOP on file to comply with the DEA's newest interpretation of enhanced and certainly more strict due diligence requirements,    Confidential    HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL�SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER    MAL-Ml 000010525 MNK-T1 0000269400 "

Attached is the powerpoint presentation and draft Customer Checklist that were discussed.    Feedback was very positive and there were good suggestions about which type of bulk customers might be considered for automatic exemption such as universities and customers who have an existing registered product, having filed an NDA or ANDA petition with FDA.    Further, a request that bulk narcotics CSRs be given some type of substantive guidance in terms of acceptance of orders on Research or Analytical Lab DEA 222 forms.    The group found it significant and noteworthy that confirmation of a customer's current DEA registration status and receipt of a DEA 222 Form are not alone adequate in determining whether an order is suspicious.    We encouraged additional comments and feedback on the draft Customer Checklist and list of triggers, there was no opposition to the concept that Field Sales is key in knowing our customers and that Customer Checklist would be an integral part of the revised Suspicious Order Monitoring Program.

Pretty well    Interesting, the group decided that the actual day-to-day monitoring responsibility should be    switched to a non-customer service function in that those that have responsibility to manage    the orders have a conflict of interest in deciding which orders should ultimately be shipped    -- with ultimate right of refusal retained by Controlled Substance Compliance.    Trade Compliance stepped up to the plate and the obligation will be transferred to them, they    have access to contractual and pricing data and are located physically in Building 10 so that    they can more readily check with Commercial Group.    The Peculiar Order report would be vetted by them and okayed by Controlled Substance    Compliance on a daily basis.    First transition meeting will be set up next week.    Other sub-teams include:    1)Review of indirect customer data availability and make a recommendation for Steering    Committee Review as to how we should use the information and what the resource requirements    should be    2)Revamp of the existing Customer Checklist to include a question such as: do you (as our    customer) verify that your customers have a CFR compliant Suspicious Order Monitoring Program    3)Customer Audit Checklist preparation and recommendation for Steering Committee about    frequency of audits, who should be on the audit team, etc.    Karen Harper    Mallinckrodt/Covidien Pharmaceuticals    Senior Manager, Controlled Substance Compliance    Global Logistics Group    office phone (314) 654-1868    cellular (314) 401-1573    This information may be confidential and/or privileged.
