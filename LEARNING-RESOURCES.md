## UCSF Library Data Science and Open Scholarship Group

The UCSF library’s Data Science and Open Scholarship Team builds computational and data skills in the UCSF community by providing education and resources to trainees, faculty, and staff.

<https://library.ucsf.edu/data-science>

This page provides registration links for upcoming programming and data science workshops, news items on data science related topics, and a scheduling/booking system for consultations with library data science librarians and specialists.  
*Note - some of these resources are limited to UCSF affiliates.*

## UCSF CLE (Collaborative Learning Environment)

Recordings, code repositories, and tutorial links for the workshops in this series are available on the UCSF CLE at:

<https://courses.ucsf.edu/course/index.php?categoryid=930>

## Software Carpentry Tutorials

The intro Python and SQL workshops in this series are based closely on material from Software Carpentry, an organization that provides lessons and workshops on topics related to research programming and computational lab skills.

#### Software Carpentry (general page)
<https://software-carpentry.org>

#### Plotting and Programming in Python
<https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/>

#### Data Management with SQL for Ecologists

## UCSF LinkedIn Learning

If you’re looking for more learning material related to Data Science and AI, I’d highly recommend you take a look at what is available on LinkedIn Learning. UCSF has a sitewide license, so you don’t need to set up (and pay for) an account — you can log in with your UCSF account at:

<https://learning.ucsf.edu/content/linkedin-learning>

There’s a lot of great content here, but if you’re interested in data science and machine learning, I’d recommend two workshops by Lillian Pierson: “Python For Data Science and Machine..."

If you’ve already taken the UCSF Library workshops on Machine Learning and NLP, there is still plenty of new material, and it can always help cement learning to review material from another angle.

Another bonus — these LinkedIn Learning courses use Python and Jupyter Notebook, so you’re already set up and ready to go!

> **Note:** These LinkedIn Learning courses are available to anyone with an account, so you don’t need to be a UCSF affiliate to access them. However, if you are a UCSF affiliate, please don’t set up your own paid account — you already have access through the link above!

## Industry Documents Library

Many of the workshops reference material from the Industry Documents Library, a digital archive containing millions of documents which have been publicly released from industries that influence public health.

This resource contains a wide range of media formats, including text, image, audio, video, spreadsheet, and other file formats. Many of the techniques used to extract information from these file types throughout this workshop series will make use of public data hosted on the IDL website.

<https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/home/>

## Prepared Data Sets

Some of the document collections from the UCSF Archives & Special Collections and the UCSF Industry Documents Library have been converted into tabular data files for researchers, with columns for metadata, embedded text, and other descriptive data related to media files. These prepared datasets are designed to provide access to collections without requiring researchers to build their own OCR, Object Detection, or Audio Transcription pipelines. 

#### Prepared Data Sets Libguide
https://guides.ucsf.edu/c.php?g=1298409&p=9537976

This workshop will use the "DC Leaks Coca-Cola Emails (Food Collections)" collection to illustrate how to query text through SQL, clean and prepare text for Natural Language Processing, and compare to AI based text extraction tools.

## Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Clinical Data Repository

Although this workshop series primarily focuses on text data, we will also use numerical, ordinal, and binary data. To illustrate many of these techniques, several of the workshops will refer to a COVID testing dataset provided by Carbon Health and Braid Health.
