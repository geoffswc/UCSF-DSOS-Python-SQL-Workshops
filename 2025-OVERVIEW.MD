# Document Analysis Workshop Series: Introduction and Curriculum Overview

## Senario - Analyzing Depositions from the Industry Documents Library

The [Industry Documents Archive](https://www.industrydocuments.ucsf.edu/home/) contains millions of documents, including thousands of hours of depositions. Even with metadata and search terms, it's often too much to manually review.

Some approaches to improving analysis include:

- Transcribing and indexing video content  
- Extracting topics, sentiment, and key entities  
- Detecting objects and identifying speakers  
- Building tools to query and summarize content  
- Creating chatbots to answer questions from transcripts

Whatever your approach, you'll almost certainly need tools like Python, SQL, and AI/ML APIs and packages. This workshop series is designed to give you the tools to analyze large volumes of media and document files from library collections like the IDL. 

## Introduction

This workshop series will guide you through the key skills needed for document analysis using Python, SQL, and AI tools. The goal is to build up from basic programming concepts to creating a full workflow that processes multimedia documents such as videos and audio files. You will learn how to:
* download videos and image files
* extract audio
* split it into chunks
* transcribe speech
* identify speakers
* recognize key objects and describe them
* classify records by topic
* assess the sentiment of text (positive/negative/neutral)
* organize the data using pandas
* run SQL-style queries to find elements in the data
* apply AI models for classification and topic analysis.
